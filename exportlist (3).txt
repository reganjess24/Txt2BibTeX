   abstract = {Whole-cell screening of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a mainstay of drug discovery, but subsequent target elucidation often proves difficult. Conditional mutants that underexpress essential genes have been used to identify compounds with known mechanism of action by target-based whole-cell screening (TB-WCS). Here, the feasibility of TB-WCS in Mtb was assessed by generating mutants that conditionally express pantothenate synthetase (panC), diaminopimelate decarboxylase (lysA), and isocitrate lyase (icl1). The essentiality of panC and lysA, and conditional essentiality of icl1 for growth on fatty acids, was confirmed. Depletion of PanC and Icl1 rendered mutants hypersensitive to target-specific inhibitors. Stable reporter strains were generated for use in high-throughput screening, and their utility was demonstrated by identifying compounds that display greater potency against a PanC-depleted strain. These findings illustrate the power of TB-WCS as a tool for tuberculosis drug discovery.},

   abstract = {Candida auris, a recently recognized, often multidrug-resistant yeast, has become a significant fungal pathogen due to its ability to cause invasive infections and outbreaks in healthcare facilities which have been difficult to control and treat. The extraordinary abilities of C. auris to easily contaminate the environment around colonized patients and persist for long periods have recently resulted in major outbreaks in many countries. C. auris resists elimination by robust cleaning and other decontamination procedures, likely due to the formation of 'dry' biofilms. Susceptible hospitalized patients, particularly those with multiple comorbidities in intensive care settings, acquire C. auris rather easily from close contact with C. auris-infected patients, their environment, or the equipment used on colonized patients, often with fatal consequences. This review highlights the lessons learned from recent studies on the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, susceptibility, and molecular basis of resistance to antifungal drugs and infection control measures to combat the spread of C. auris infections in healthcare facilities. Particular emphasis is given to interventions aiming to prevent new infections in healthcare facilities, including the screening of susceptible patients for colonization; the cleaning and decontamination of the environment, equipment, and colonized patients; and successful approaches to identify and treat infected patients, particularly during outbreaks.},

   abstract = {Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are common causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with hematologic diseases. Delayed initiation of antifungal treatment is related to mortality. Aspergillus sp. is the leading cause of IFI followed by Candida sp. Diagnosis is often challenging owing to variable conditions related to underlying diseases. Clinical suspect and prompt management is important. Imaging, biopsy, and non-culture-based tests must be considered together. New diagnostic procedures have been improved, including antigen-based assays and molecular detection of fungal DNA. Among hematologic diseases, patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are at high risk for IFIs. Antifungal prophylaxis is recommended for these high-risk patients. There are continuous attempts to achieve ideal management of IFIs. Scoring system for quality control has been developed with important recommendations of current guidelines. Higher adherence to guidelines is related to decreased mortality in IFIs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of rare neurogenetic disorders frequently associated with iron accumulation in the basal nuclei of the brain characterized by progressive spasticity, dystonia, muscle rigidity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and retinal degeneration or optic nerve atrophy. Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is one of the most widespread NBIA subtypes. It is caused by mutations in the gene of pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) that result in dysfunction in PANK2 enzyme activity, with consequent deficiency of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, as well as low levels of essential metabolic intermediates such as 4'-phosphopantetheine, a necessary cofactor for essential cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins. METHODS: In this manuscript, we examined the therapeutic effectiveness of pantothenate, panthetine, antioxidants (vitamin E and omega 3) and mitochondrial function boosting supplements (L-carnitine and thiamine) in mutant PANK2 cells with residual expression levels. RESULTS: Commercial supplements, pantothenate, pantethine, vitamin E, omega 3, carnitine and thiamine were able to eliminate iron accumulation, increase PANK2, mtACP, and NFS1 expression levels and improve pathological alterations in mutant cells with residual PANK2 expression levels. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that several commercial compounds are indeed able to significantly correct the mutant phenotype in cellular models of PKAN. These compounds alone or in combinations are of common use in clinical practice and may be useful for the treatment of PKAN patients with residual enzyme expression levels.},

   abstract = {Molds are ubiquitous in the environment, and immunocompromised patients are at substantial risk of morbidity and mortality due to their underlying disease and the resistance of pathogenic molds to currently recommended antifungal therapies. This combination of weakened-host defense, with limited antifungal treatment options, and the opportunism of environmental molds renders patients at risk and especially vulnerable to invasive mold infections such as Aspergillus and members of the Order Mucorales. Currently, available antifungal drugs such as azoles and echinocandins, as well as combinations of the same, offer some degree of efficacy in the prevention and treatment of invasive mold infections, but their use is often limited by drug resistance mechanisms, toxicity, drug-drug interactions, and the relative paucity of oral treatment options. Clearly, there is a need for agents that are of a new class that provides adequate tissue penetration, can be administered orally, and have broad-spectrum efficacy against fungal infections, including those caused by invasive mold organisms. Ibrexafungerp, an orally bioavailable glucan synthase inhibitor, is the first in a new class of triterpenoid antifungals and shares a similar target to the well-established echinocandins. Ibrexafungerp has a very favorable pharmacokinetic profile for the treatment of fungal infections with excellent tissue penetration in organs targeted by molds, such as the lungs, liver, and skin. Ibrexafungerp has demonstrated in vitro activity against Aspergillus spp. as well as efficacy in animal models of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Furthermore, ibrexafungerp is approved for use in the USA for the treatment of women with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Ibrexafungerp is currently being evaluated in clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination with other antifungals for treating invasive fungal infections caused by yeasts and molds. Thus, ibrexafungerp offers promise as a new addition to the clinician's armamentarium against these difficult-to-treat infections.},

   abstract = {Due to the continued emergence of resistance and a lack of new and promising antibiotics, bacterial infection has become a major public threat. High-throughput screening (HTS) allows rapid screening of a large collection of molecules for bioactivity testing and holds promise in antibacterial drug discovery. More than 50% of the antibiotics that are currently available on the market are derived from natural products. However, with the easily discoverable antibiotics being found, finding new antibiotics from natural sources has seen limited success. Finding new natural sources for antibacterial activity testing has also proven to be challenging. In addition to exploring new sources of natural products and synthetic biology, omics technology helped to study the biosynthetic machinery of existing natural sources enabling the construction of unnatural synthesizers of bioactive molecules and the identification of molecular targets of antibacterial agents. On the other hand, newer and smarter strategies have been continuously pursued to screen synthetic molecule libraries for new antibiotics and new druggable targets. Biomimetic conditions are explored to mimic the real infection model to better study the ligand-target interaction to enable the designing of more effective antibacterial drugs. This narrative review describes various traditional and contemporaneous approaches of high-throughput screening of natural products and synthetic molecule libraries for antibacterial drug discovery. It further discusses critical factors for HTS assay design, makes a general recommendation, and discusses possible alternatives to traditional HTS of natural products and synthetic molecule libraries for antibacterial drug discovery.},

   abstract = {One potentially rich source of possible targets for antifungal therapy are those Candida albicans genes deemed essential for growth under the standard culture (i.e., in vitro) conditions; however, these genes are largely unexplored as drug targets because essential genes are not experimentally amenable to conventional gene deletion and virulence studies. Using tetracycline-regulatable promoter-based conditional mutants, we investigated a murine model of candidiasis in which repressing essential genes in the host was achieved. By adding doxycycline to the drinking water starting 3 days prior to (dox - 3D) or 2 days post (dox + 2D) infection, the phenotypic consequences of temporal gene inactivation were assessed by monitoring animal survival and fungal burden in prophylaxis and acute infection settings. Of 177 selected conditional shut-off strains tested, the virulence of 102 was blocked under both repressing conditions, suggesting that the corresponding genes are essential for growth and survival in a murine host across early and established infection periods. Among these genes were those previously identified as antifungal drug targets (i.e., FKS1, ERG1, and ERG11), verifying that this methodology can be used to validate potential new targets. We also identify genes either conditionally essential or dispensable for in vitro growth but required for survival and virulence, including those in late stage ergosterol synthesis, or early steps in fatty acid or riboflavin biosynthesis. This study evaluates the role of essential genes with respect to pathogen virulence in a large-scale, systems biology context, and provides a general method for gene target validation and for uncovering unexpected antimicrobial targets.},

They are often used for prolonged (weeks to months) periods of time, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies, or in those who have received a solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Long-term use of azoles is associated with hepatotoxicity and hormone-related effects, including gynecomastia, alopecia, decreased libido, oligospermia, azoospermia, impotence, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and (rarely) adrenal insufficiency. Voriconazole and posaconazole have been associated with peripheral neuropathies, and itraconazole and voriconazole with pancreatitis. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with periostitis, phototoxic reactions, and squamous cell carcinoma. Since many at-risk patients are commonly receiving multiple medications, it can be difficult for care providers to identify antifungal agent causality or contribution to patient symptoms. Knowledge and recognition of adverse events caused by azoles, leading to dose reduction or discontinuation, can generally reverse these adverse events.},

   abstract = {The standard caspofungin treatment regimen (50 mg/day after a 70-mg dose on day 1) is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of invasive candidiasis, but experience with higher doses of caspofungin is limited. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of caspofungin at 3 times the standard dosing regimen.|Patients with proven invasive candidiasis were randomized to receive a standard or high-dose (150 mg/day) caspofungin treatment regimen. Safety was assessed in all patients as treated. Efficacy was assessed as a secondary objective in a full-analysis-set population. A favorable overall response was defined as symptom resolution and microbiological clearance at the end of caspofungin therapy.|A total of 204 patients were included in the safety analysis (104 received the standard regimen, and 100 received the high-dose regimen), and 197 were included in the efficacy analysis (102 and 95 in the standard and high-dose treatment groups, respectively). Patient demographic characteristics, neutropenia status (6.7% and 8.0% had neutropenia, respectively), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (mean, 16.5 and 17, respectively) were similar between treatment groups. Significant drug-related adverse events occurred in 1.9% of patients receiving the standard regimen and 3.0% of patients receiving the high-dose regimen (difference, 1.1%; 95% confidence interval, -4.1% to 6.8%). The most-common drug-related adverse events in the standard and high-dose treatment groups were phlebitis (3.8% and 2.0%, respectively), increased alkaline phosphatase level (6.9% and 2.0%, respectively), and increased aspartate transaminase level (4.0% and 2.0%, respectively). Overall, 71.6% of patients who received the standard regimen and 77.9% of patients who received the high-dose regimen had favorable overall responses (difference, 6.3%; 95% confidence interval, -5.9% to 18.4%; not statistically significant). Mortality at 8 weeks after therapy was similar between groups.|Both caspofungin dosing regimens were effective and well tolerated in patients with invasive candidiasis. No safety concerns were found for caspofungin at a dosage of 150 mg/day.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterial causative agent of tuberculosis, currently affects millions of people. The emergence of drug-resistant strains makes development of new antibiotics targeting the bacterium a global health priority. Pantothenate kinase, a key enzyme in the universal biosynthesis of the essential cofactor CoA, was targeted in this study to find new tuberculosis drugs. The biochemical characterizations of two new classes of compounds that inhibit pantothenate kinase from M. tuberculosis are described, along with crystal structures of their enzyme-inhibitor complexes. These represent the first crystal structures of this enzyme with engineered inhibitors. Both classes of compounds bind in the active site of the enzyme, overlapping with the binding sites of the natural substrate and product, pantothenate and phosphopantothenate, respectively. One class of compounds also interferes with binding of the cofactor ATP. The complexes were crystallized in two crystal forms, one of which is in a new space group for this enzyme and diffracts to the highest resolution reported for any pantothenate kinase structure. These two crystal forms allowed, for the first time, modeling of the cofactor-binding loop in both open and closed conformations. The structures also show a binding mode of ATP different from that previously reported for the M. tuberculosis enzyme but similar to that in the pantothenate kinases of other organisms.},

   abstract = {The general secretion (Sec) pathway is a conserved essential pathway in bacteria and is the primary route of protein export across the cytoplasmic membrane. During protein export, the signal peptidase LepB catalyzes the cleavage of the signal peptide and subsequent release of mature proteins into the extracellular space. We developed a target-based whole cell assay to screen for potential inhibitors of LepB, the sole signal peptidase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using a strain engineered to underexpress LepB (LepB-UE). We screened 72,000 compounds against both the Lep-UE and wild-type (wt) strains. We identified the phenylhydrazone (PHY) series as having higher activity against the LepB-UE strain. We conducted a limited structure-activity relationship determination around a representative PHY compound with differential activity (MICs of 3.0 muM against the LepB-UE strain and 18 muM against the wt); several analogues were less potent against the LepB overexpressing strain. A number of chemical modifications around the hydrazone moiety resulted in improved potency. Inhibition of LepB activity was observed for a number of compounds in a biochemical assay using cell membrane fraction derived from M. tuberculosis. Compounds did not increase cell permeability, dissipate membrane potential, or inhibit an unrelated mycobacterial enzyme, suggesting a specific mode of action related to the LepB secretory mechanism.},

In Brazil, only the conventional formulation is provided by the Public Health System. The aim of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing conventional amphotericin B (CAB), liposomal amphotericin B (LAB) and amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC). Therefore, a decision tree was developed. The model began with high-risking patients on suspicion or confirmation of IFI. The analysis was conducted under the perspective of the Brazilian Public Health System. Model health states were defined according to medication use and clinical evolution. Clinical efficacy (cure) and transition probabilities were derived from the literature. Resource use was estimated from Brazilian data. Time horizon followed the maximum treatment time determined in the patient information leaflets (3 or 6 weeks). One-way and probabilistic-sensitivity analyses were conducted. The conventional formulation was the most cost-effective. No dominance was observed; however, high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were obtained for LAB (USD 313 130) and ABLC (USD 1 711 280). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results. CAB is the most cost-effective treatment, followed by LAB and ABLC. Although CAB presents critical safety aspects, the high acquisition costs of the other formulations prevent their large-scale use in Brazil.},

   abstract = {The oral cavity provides a unique ecological site that harbors a dynamic microbiota. Candida, Aspergillus, and Rhizopus are commensal oral fungi. However, they may become pathological and cause opportunistic infections under certain conditions. The incidence of fungal infections has been on the rise in recent years, especially in COVID 19 patients, due to several factors such as immunodeficiency, hyperglycemia caused by diabetes mellitus, prolonged hospitalizations, and prolonged use of steroids, and hematopoietic malignancies. The advent of newer therapies for several diseases has also influenced the incidence of fungal infections. The diagnosis of oral fungal infections is mainly based on clinical presentation, cytology, and histopathology of the lesional tissue. The methods to detect fungal organisms have also evolved from culture to rapid molecular tests like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Prompt evaluation of oral lesions is essential to establish the diagnosis, initiate therapy, and monitor clinical progress. This article focuses on the epidemiology, patient history, risk factors, oral findings, diagnosis, and treatment of the oral cavity fungal infections, including oral candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis/zygomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and geotrichosis.},

Here we made progress toward this elusive goal by targeting a noncatalytic cysteine in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) with reversible covalent inhibitors. Using an inverted orientation of the cysteine-reactive cyanoacrylamide electrophile, we identified potent and selective BTK inhibitors that demonstrated biochemical residence times spanning from minutes to 7 d. An inverted cyanoacrylamide with prolonged residence time in vivo remained bound to BTK for more than 18 h after clearance from the circulation. The inverted cyanoacrylamide strategy was further used to discover fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitors with residence times of several days, demonstrating the generalizability of the approach. Targeting of noncatalytic cysteines with inverted cyanoacrylamides may serve as a broadly applicable platform that facilitates 'residence time by design', the ability to modulate and improve the duration of target engagement in vivo.},

   abstract = {Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, caused by mutations in the PANK2 gene, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by dystonia, dysarthria, rigidity, pigmentary retinal degeneration and brain iron accumulation. PANK2 encodes the mitochondrial enzyme pantothenate kinase type 2, responsible for the phosphorylation of pantothenate or vitamin B5 in the biosynthesis of co-enzyme A. A Pank2 knockout (Pank2(-/-)) mouse model did not recapitulate the human disease but showed azoospermia and mitochondrial dysfunctions. We challenged this mouse model with a low glucose and high lipid content diet (ketogenic diet) to stimulate lipid use by mitochondrial beta-oxidation. In the presence of a shortage of co-enzyme A, this diet could evoke a general impairment of bioenergetic metabolism. Only Pank2(-/-) mice fed with a ketogenic diet developed a pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration-like syndrome characterized by severe motor dysfunction, neurodegeneration and severely altered mitochondria in the central and peripheral nervous systems. These mice also showed structural alteration of muscle morphology, which was comparable with that observed in a patient with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. We here demonstrate that pantethine administration can prevent the onset of the neuromuscular phenotype in mice suggesting the possibility of experimental treatment in patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration.},

   abstract = {Despite decades of dedicated research, there remains a dire need for new drugs against tuberculosis (TB). Current therapies are generations old and problematic. Resistance to these existing therapies results in an ever-increasing burden of patients with disease that is difﬁcult or impossible to treat. Novel chemical entities with new mechanisms of action are therefore earnestly required. The biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) has long been known to be essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB. The pathway has been genetically validated by seminal studies in vitro and in vivo. In Mtb, the CoA biosynthetic pathway is comprised of nine enzymes: four to synthesize pantothenate (Pan) from L-aspartate and a-ketoisovalerate; ﬁve to synthesize CoA from Pan and pantetheine (PantSH). This review gathers literature reports on the structure/ mechanism, inhibitors, and vulnerability of each enzyme in the CoA pathway. In addition to traditional inhibition of a single enzyme, the CoA pathway offers an antimetabolite strategy as a promising alternative. In this review, we provide our assessment of what appear to be the best targets, and, thus, which CoA pathway enzymes present the best opportunities for antitubercular drug discovery moving forward.},

   abstract = {Traditional approaches to drug discovery are frustratingly inefficient and have several key limitations that severely constrain our capacity to rapidly identify and develop novel experimental therapeutics. To address this, we have devised a second-generation target-based whole-cell screening assay based on the principles of competitive fitness, which can rapidly identify target-specific and physiologically active compounds. Briefly, strains expressing high, intermediate, and low levels of a preselected target protein are constructed, tagged with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins (FPs), and pooled. The pooled strains are then grown in the presence of various small molecules, and the relative growth of each strain within the mixed culture is compared by measuring the intensity of the corresponding FP tags. Chemical-induced population shifts indicate that the bioactivity of a small molecule is dependent upon the target protein's abundance and thus establish a specific functional interaction. Here, we describe the molecular tools required to apply this technique in the prevalent human fungal pathogen Candida albicans and validate the approach using two well-characterized drug targets-lanosterol demethylase and dihydrofolate reductase. However, our approach, which we have termed target abundance-based fitness screening (TAFiS), should be applicable to a wide array of molecular targets and in essentially any genetically tractable microbe. IMPORTANCE Conventional drug screening typically employs either target-based or cell-based approaches. The first group relies on biochemical assays to detect modulators of a purified target. However, hits frequently lack drug-like characteristics such as membrane permeability and target specificity. Cell-based screens identify compounds that induce a desired phenotype, but the target is unknown, which severely restricts further development and optimization. To address these issues, we have developed a second-generation target-based whole-cell screening approach that incorporates the principles of both chemical genetics and competitive fitness, which enables the identification of target-specific and physiologically active compounds from a single screen. We have chosen to validate this approach using the important human fungal pathogen Candida albicans with the intention of pursuing novel antifungal targets. However, this approach is broadly applicable and is expected to dramatically reduce the time and resources required to progress from screening hit to lead compound.},

   abstract = {We describe a sibling pair displaying an early infantile-onset, progressive neurodegenerative phenotype, with symptoms of developmental delay and epileptic encephalopathy developing from 12 to 14 months of age. Using whole exome sequencing, compound heterozygous variants were identified in SLC5A6, which encodes the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) protein. SMVT is an important transporter of the B-group vitamins biotin, pantothenate, and lipoate. The protein is ubiquitously expressed and has major roles in vitamin uptake in the digestive system, as well as transport of these vitamins across the blood-brain barrier. Pathogenicity of the identified variants was demonstrated by impaired biotin uptake of mutant SMVT. Identification of this vitamin transporter as the genetic basis of this disorder guided targeted therapeutic intervention, resulting clinically in improvement of the patient's neurocognitive and neuromotor function. This is the second report of biallelic mutations in SLC5A6 leading to a neurodegenerative disorder due to impaired biotin, pantothenate and lipoate uptake. The genetic and phenotypic overlap of these cases confirms mutations in SLC5A6 as the genetic cause of this disease phenotype. Recognition of the genetic disorder caused by SLC5A6 mutations is essential for early diagnosis and to facilitate timely intervention by triple vitamin (biotin, pantothenate, and lipoate) replacement therapy.},

The PanK gene from Escherichia coli (coaA) has been previously cloned and the enzyme biochemically characterized; highly related genes exist in other prokaryotes. We isolated a PanK cDNA clone from the eukaryotic fungus Aspergillus nidulans by functional complementation of a temperature-sensitive E. coli PanK mutant. The cDNA clone allowed the isolation of the genomic clone and the characterization of the A. nidulans gene designated panK. The panK gene is located on chromosome 3 (linkage group III), is interrupted by three small introns, and is expressed constitutively. The amino acid sequence of A. nidulans PanK (aPanK) predicted a subunit size of 46.9 kDa and bore little resemblance to its bacterial counterpart, whereas a highly related protein was detected in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to E. coli PanK (bPanK), which is regulated by CoA and to a lesser extent by its thioesters, aPanK activity was selectively and potently inhibited by acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA inhibition of aPanK was competitive with respect to ATP. Thus, the eukaryotic PanK has a distinct primary structure and unique regulatory properties that clearly distinguish it from its prokaryotic counterpart.},

   abstract = {Coenzyme A (CoA) is a vital and ubiquitous cofactor required in a vast number of enzymatic reactions and cellular processes. To date, four rare human inborn errors of CoA biosynthesis have been described. These disorders have distinct symptoms, although all stem from variants in genes that encode enzymes involved in the same metabolic process. The first and last enzymes catalyzing the CoA biosynthetic pathway are associated with two neurological conditions, namely pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) and COASY protein-associated neurodegeneration (CoPAN), which belong to the heterogeneous group of neurodegenerations with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), while the second and third enzymes are linked to a rapidly fatal dilated cardiomyopathy. There is still limited information about the pathogenesis of these diseases, and the knowledge gaps need to be resolved in order to develop potential therapeutic approaches. This review aims to provide a summary of CoA metabolism and functions, and a comprehensive overview of what is currently known about disorders associated with its biosynthesis, including available preclinical models, proposed pathomechanisms, and potential therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {Early treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) is essential for optimal clinical outcomes. Standard antifungal drugs (polyenes, azoles and echinocandins) are not predictably effective against emerging yeasts and filamentous fungi and may cause undesirable side effects. Species identification can guide antifungal selection for invasive candidiasis, but not less common moulds such as Scedosporium and Fusarium spp. Management strategies targeted to those at highest risk (prophylaxis), those with clinical signs of infection not responsive to antibacterials (empiric therapy) and those with occult infection (asymptomatic but with positive fungal biomarkers) produce better outcomes than therapy predicated on identification of a fungal pathogen, but require comparative evaluation. Appropriate dosing and consideration of pharmacokinetic parameters (including therapeutic drug monitoring) are important with newer triazoles. New therapies such as addition of the iron chelator, deferasirox, in the treatment of zygomycosis in diabetic patients, appear promising but additional agents with new targets of action are urgently needed.},

   abstract = {This review compares the pharmacology, spectrum of antifungal activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, safety and clinical efficacy of the three licensed echinocandins: caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin. Echinocandins inhibit the synthesis of 1,3-β-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall, and represent a valuable treatment option for fungal infections. The echinocandins exhibit potent in vitro and in vivo fungicidal activity against Candida species, including azole-resistant pathogens. For all agents, strains with drug minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ≤ 2 μg/mL are considered susceptible; the MIC at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (MIC₉₀) values are typically <2 μg/mL but 100-fold higher MIC₉₀ values are seen with Candida parapsilosis (1-2 μg/mL) and Candida guilliermondii (1-4 μg/mL). Activity is comparable between the three agents, although limited data indicate that anidulafungin may have low MICs against C. parapsilosis and Candida glabrata strains that demonstrate elevated MICs to caspofungin and micafungin. All three drugs have good fungistatic activity against Aspergillus spp., although minimal effective concentrations of micafungin and anidulfungin are 2- to 10-fold lower than those for caspofungin. Synergistic/additive in vitro effects of echinocandins when combined with a polyene or azole have been observed. Clinical resistance to the echinocandins is rare despite case reports of caspofungin resistance in several Candida spp. Resistance has been attributed to mutations in the FKS1 gene within two hot spot regions, leading to amino acid substitutions, mostly at position 645 (serine), yet not all FKS1 mutants have caspofungin MICs of >2 μg/mL. Of the three echinocandins, the in vitro 'paradoxical effect' (increased growth at supra-MIC drug concentrations) is observed least often with anidulafungin. All echinocandins have low oral bioavailability, and distribute well into tissues, but poorly into the CNS and eye. Anidulafungin is unique in that it undergoes elimination by chemical degradation in bile rather than via hepatic metabolism, has a lower maximum concentration and smaller steady state under the concentration-time curve but longer half-life than caspofungin or micafungin. In children, dosing should be based on body surface area. Daily doses of caspofungin (but not micafungin and anidulafungin) should be decreased (from 50 to 35 mg) in moderate liver insufficiency. All echinocandins display concentration-dependent fungicidal (for Candida) or fungistatic (for Aspergillus) activity. The postantifungal effect is 0.9-20 hours against Candida and <0.5 hours against Aspergillus. The echinocandins are well tolerated with few serious drug-drug interactions since they are not appreciable substrates, inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome P450 or P-glycoprotein systems. In parallel with the greater clinical experience with caspofungin, this agent has a slightly higher potential for adverse effects/drug-drug interactions, with the least potential observed for anidulafungin. Caspofungin (but not micafungin or anidulafungin) dosing should be increased if coadministered with rifampicin and there are modest interactions of caspofungin with calcineurin inhibitors. All three agents are approved for the treatment of oesophageal candidiasis, candidaemia and other select forms of invasive candidiasis. Only micafungin is licensed for antifungal prophylaxis in stem cell transplantation, whereas caspofungin is approved for empirical therapy of febrile neutropenia. Caspofungin has been evaluated in the salvage and primary therapy of invasive aspergillosis. Combination regimens incorporating an echinocandin showing promise in the treatment of aspergillosis. However, echinocandins remain expensive to use.},

Clinically useful "older" agents include topical azole formulations (for superficial yeast and dermatophyte infections), first-generation triazoles (fluconazole and itraconazole, for a range of superficial and invasive fungal infections), amphotericin B formulations (for a broad range of invasive fungal infections) and terbinafine (for dermatophyte infections).

Caspofungin and the other echinocandins are effective in treating Candida and Aspergillus infections. The azoles are relatively safe, but clinicians should be aware of drug-drug interactions and adverse effects, including visual disturbances (with voriconazole), elevations in liver transaminase levels, and skin rashes. Caspofungin has minimal adverse effects. Combination antifungal therapy may be appropriate in selected patients with invasive fungal infections, but is empiric and driven by individual physician practice.},

   abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is a pathogenic fungus with a global distribution. Humans become infected by inhaling the fungus from the environment, and the fungus initially colonizes the lungs. If the immune system fails to contain C. neoformans in the lungs, the fungus can disseminate to the blood and invade the central nervous system, resulting in fatal meningoencephalitis particularly in immunocompromised individuals including HIV/AIDS patients. Following brain invasion, C. neoformans will encounter host defenses involving resident as well as recruited immune cells in the brain. To overcome host defenses, C. neoformans possesses multiple virulence factors capable of modulating immune responses. The outcome of the interactions between the host and C. neoformans will determine the disease progression. In this review, we describe the current understanding of how C. neoformans migrates to the brain across the blood-brain barrier, and how the host immune system responds to the invading organism in the brain. We will also discuss the virulence factors that C. neoformans uses to modulate host immune responses.},

   abstract = {In fungi, ergosterol is an essential component of the plasma membrane. Its biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA is the primary target of the most commonly used antifungal drugs. Here, we show that the pantothenate kinase Cab1p, which catalyzes the first step in the metabolism of pantothenic acid for CoA biosynthesis in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), significantly regulates the levels of sterol intermediates and the activities of ergosterol biosynthesis-targeting antifungals. Using genetic and pharmacological analyses, we show that altered pantothenate utilization dramatically alters the susceptibility of yeast cells to ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors. Genome-wide transcription and MS-based analyses revealed that this regulation is mediated by changes both in the expression of ergosterol biosynthesis genes and in the levels of sterol intermediates. Consistent with these findings, drug interaction experiments indicated that inhibition of pantothenic acid utilization synergizes with the activity of the ergosterol molecule-targeting antifungal amphotericin B and antagonizes that of the ergosterol pathway-targeting antifungal drug terbinafine. Our finding that CoA metabolism controls ergosterol biosynthesis and susceptibility to antifungals could set the stage for the development of new strategies to manage fungal infections and to modulate the potency of current drugs against drug-sensitive and -resistant fungal pathogens.},

During hit and lead characterization, one sometimes observes apparently linear progress curves after jump dilution that display activity recoveries that are intermediate between those expected for fully reversible and irreversible inhibition. Computer simulations of progress curves after jump dilution indicate that seemingly linear progress curves can result when dealing with tight-binding inhibitors if substoichiometric concentrations of inhibitor are preincubated with enzyme. In this situation, the activity recovered is comparable to that expected for instantaneously reversible inhibitors. In addition, simulations demonstrate that intermediate values of activity recovery may be observed for compounds with modestly slow dissociation rates (i.e., residence times >0min but ≤20min) when the attending curvature of the data is not accounted for. The observation of intermediate values of recovery can, thus, serve as an indication of either modest residence time or a contaminating inactivator within an inhibitor sample, in either case prompting greater scrutiny of the test compound.},

   abstract = {Pantothenate (pan) auxotrophs of Escherichia coli K-12 and Salmonella typhimurium LT2 were characterized by enzymatic and genetic analyses. The panB mutants of both organisms and the pan-6 ("panA") mutant of S. typhimurium are deficient in ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase, whereas the panC mutants lack pantothenate synthetase. panD mutants of E. coli K-12 were previously shown to be deficient in aspartate 1-decarboxylase. All mutants showed only a single enzyme defect. The finding that the pan-6 mutant was deficient in ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase indicates that the genetic lesion is a panB allele. The pan-6 mutant therefore is deficient in the utilization of alpha-ketoisovalerate rather than the synthesis of alpha-ketoisovalerate, as originally proposed. The order of the pan genes of E. coli K-12 was determined by phage P1-mediated three-factor crosses. The clockwise order was found to be aceF panB panD panC tonA on the genetic map of E. coli K-12. The three-factor crosses were greatly facilitated by use of a closely linked Tn10 transposon as the outside marker. We also found that supplementation of E. coli K-12 auxotrophs with a high concentration of pantothenate or beta-alanine increased the intracellular coenzyme A level two- to threefold above the normal level. Supplementation with pantoate or ketopantoate resulted in smaller increases.},

   abstract = {The importance of coenzyme A (CoA) as a carrier of acyl residues in cell metabolism is well understood. Coenzyme A participates in more than 100 different catabolic and anabolic reactions, including those involved in the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, ethanol, bile acids, and xenobiotics. However, much less is known about the importance of the concentration of this cofactor in various cell compartments and the role of altered CoA concentration in various pathologies. Despite continuous research on these issues, the molecular mechanisms in the regulation of the intracellular level of CoA under pathological conditions are still not well understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge of (a) CoA subcellular concentrations; (b) the roles of CoA synthesis and degradation processes; and (c) protein modification by reversible CoA binding to proteins (CoAlation). Particular attention is paid to (a) the roles of changes in the level of CoA under pathological conditions, such as in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, myopathies, and infectious diseases; and (b) the beneficial effect of CoA and pantethine (which like CoA is finally converted to Pan and cysteamine), used at pharmacological doses for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.},

   title = {Assay Interference by Chemical Reactivity},
   abstract = {Real and virtual high-throughput screens (HTS) are crucial components of the modern drug discovery process. Assays that determine the biological activity of compounds found by both of these approaches may be subject to interference by a variety of processes, one of which is non-specific chemical reactivity. Within this mode of assay interference, test compounds can chemically react with assay reagent(s) or biological molecule(s), confounding the assay readout by producing apparent biological activity. Failure to identify and triage (remove from consideration) these compounds can result in wasted resources and project dead-ends. This chapter contains practical strategies to mitigate the impact of assay interference by compound chemical reactivity. Two general approaches are described to identify and triage reactive compounds in the context of drug discovery and development: knowledge-based and experimental-based methods. Knowledge-based strategies covered in this chapter include substructure filters, literature and database searches, and the consulting of experienced medicinal chemists. Experimental-based strategies covered in this chapter include mechanistic experiments, thiol-based probes and multiple types of counter-screens. Employing a well-designed and comprehensive screening tree that incorporates these strategies should reduce the likelihood of pursuing reactive assay artifacts and intractable hits from HTS campaigns.},

The CoA biosynthetic genes in bacteria have all recently been identified, but their counterparts in humans and other eukaryotes remained mostly unknown. Using comparative genomics, we have identified human genes encoding the last four enzymatic steps in CoA biosynthesis: phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (EC ), phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (EC ), phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (EC ), and dephospho-CoA kinase (EC ). Biological functions of these human genes were verified using a complementation system in Escherichia coli based on transposon mutagenesis. The individual human enzymes were overexpressed in E. coli and purified, and the corresponding activities were experimentally verified. In addition, the entire pathway from phosphopantothenate to CoA was successfully reconstituted in vitro using a mixture of purified recombinant enzymes. Human recombinant bifunctional phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase/dephospho-CoA kinase was kinetically characterized. This enzyme was previously suggested as a point of CoA biosynthesis regulation, and we have observed significant differences in mRNA levels of the corresponding human gene in normal and tumor cells by Northern blot analysis.},

   abstract = {N-substituted pantothenamides are analogues of pantothenic acid, the vitamin precursor of CoA, and constitute a class of well-studied bacterial growth inhibitors that show potential as new antibacterial agents. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of pantothenate kinase (PanK; EC 2.7.1.33) (the first enzyme of CoA biosynthesis) in mediating pantothenamide-induced growth inhibition by one of two proposed mechanisms: first, by acting on the pantothenamides as alternate substrates (allowing their conversion into CoA antimetabolites, with subsequent effects on CoA- and acyl carrier protein-dependent processes) or, second, by being directly inhibited by them (causing a reduction in CoA biosynthesis). In the present study we used structurally modified pantothenamides to probe whether PanKs interact with these compounds in the same manner. We show that the three distinct types of eubacterial PanKs that are known to exist (PanKI , PanKII and PanKIII ) respond very differently and, consequently, are responsible for determining the pantothenamide mode of action in each case: although the promiscuous PanKI enzymes accept them as substrates, the highly selective PanKIII s are resistant to their inhibitory effects. Most unexpectedly, Staphylococcus aureus PanK (the only known example of a bacterial PanKII ) experiences uncompetitive inhibition in a manner that is described for the first time. In addition, we show that pantetheine, a CoA degradation product that closely resembles the pantothenamides, causes the same effect. This suggests that, in S. aureus, pantothenamides may act by usurping a previously unknown role of pantetheine in the regulation of CoA biosynthesis, and validates its PanK as a target for the development of new antistaphylococcal agents.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Candida species are among the most prevalent microorganisms in pediatric critical care units that cause central line-associated bloodstream infections. The goal of this study was to assess the therapeutic benefit of central line bundle for the prevention of Candida species-related bloodstream infections in pediatric intensive care units. DESIGN: The study covered the period from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019. Pre-bundle and bundle phases were included in the research. The Clinical Microbiology Laboratory's records revealed episodes of Candida-related central line-associated bloodstream infections. SETTING: The study was conducted in the Dr. Behcet Uz Child Disease and Pediatric Surgery Training and Research Hospital's PICU (which has 24 beds and admits 350 patients per year). PATIENTS: This study included pediatric patients in the pediatric intensive care unit with non-tunneled central venous catheters. INTERVENTIONS: In the pediatric intensive care unit, a central line bundle was started. RESULTS: A total of 236 Candida-related central line-associated bloodstream infections were discovered during the study period. Non-albicans Candida accounted for 83.5% (197) of the total, whereas C.albicans accounted for 16.5%(39). During the pre-bundle period, 137 Candida species were isolated from the patients, while 99 Candida species were isolated during the bundle period. Candida-related central line-associated bloodstream infections dropped from 13.68 to 5.93 per 1000 CL-days after the central line bundle was used (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, the central line bundle greatly reduced central line-associated Candida species bloodstream infections. Central line bundles are an effective scientific solution for preventing Candida-related central line-associated bloodstream infections in hospitals with high Candida prevalence.},

To determine whether this phenotype was strain or condition specific, the effect of pantothenate supplementation on PZA activity was assessed using prototrophic strains of M. tuberculosis. It was found that pantothenate and other β-alanine-containing metabolites abolished PZA and POA susceptibility, suggesting that POA might selectively target pantothenate synthesis. However, when the pantothenate-auxotrophic strain was cultivated using a subantagonistic concentration of pantetheine in lieu of pantothenate, susceptibility to PZA and POA was restored. In addition, we found that β-alanine could not antagonize PZA and POA activity against the pantothenate-auxotrophic strain, indicating that the antagonism is specific to pantothenate. Moreover, pantothenate-mediated antagonism was observed for structurally related compounds, including n-propyl pyrazinoate, 5-chloropyrazinamide, and nicotinamide, but not for nicotinic acid or isoniazid. Taken together, these data demonstrate that while pantothenate can interfere with the action of PZA, pantothenate synthesis is not directly targeted by PZA. Our findings suggest that targeting of pantothenate synthesis has the potential to enhance PZA efficacy and possibly to restore PZA susceptibility in isolates with panD-linked resistance.},

The study examined the development histories of these investigational compounds from the time point at which they first entered clinical testing (1993-2004) through June 2009. The clinical approval success rate in the United States was 16% for self-originated drugs (originating from the pharmaceutical company itself) during both the 1993-1998 and the 1999-2004 subperiods. For all compounds (including licensed-in and licensed-out drugs in addition to self-originated drugs), the clinical approval success rate for the entire study period was 19%. The estimated clinical approval success rates and phase transition probabilities differed significantly by therapeutic class. The estimated clinical approval success rate for self-originated compounds over the entire study period was 32% for large molecules and 13% for small molecules. The estimated transition probabilities were also higher for all clinical phases with respect to large molecules.},

The most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (32%), Staphylococcus aureus (16%), and enterococci (11%). Enterobacter, Serratia, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Candida were more likely to cause infections in patients in critical care units. In patients with neutropenia, viridans streptococci were significantly more common. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common pathogens on all clinical services except obstetrics, where Escherichia coli was most common. Methicillin resistance was detected in 29% of S. aureus isolates and 80% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Vancomycin resistance in enterococci was species-dependent--3% of Enterococcus faecalis strains and 50% of Enterococcus faecium isolates displayed resistance. These data may allow clinicians to better target empirical therapy for hospital-acquired cases of bacteremia.},

   abstract = {The first echinocandin-type antimycotic (echinocandin B) was discovered in the 1970s. It was followed by the isolation of more than 20 natural echinocandins. These cyclic lipo-hexapeptides are biosynthesized on non-ribosomal peptide synthase complexes by different ascomycota fungi. They have a unique mechanism of action; as non-competitive inhibitors of beta-1,3-glucan synthase complex they target the fungal cell wall. Results of the structure-activity relationship experiments let us develop semisynthetic derivatives with improved properties. Three cyclic lipohiexapeptides (caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin) are currently approved for use in clinics. As they show good fungicidal (Candida spp.) or fungistatic (Aspergillus spp.) activity against the most important human pathogenic fungi including azole-resistant strains, they are an important addition to the antifungal armamentarium. Some evidence of acquired resistance against echinocandins has been detected among Candida glabrata strains in recent years, which enhanced the importance of data collected on the mechanism of acquired resistance developing against the echinocandins. In this review, we show the structural diversity of natural echinocandins, and we summarize the emerging data on their mode of action, biosynthesis and industrial production. Their clinical significance as well as the mechanism of natural and acquired resistance is also discussed.},

   abstract = {Coenzyme A (CoA) is a ubiquitous coenzyme involved in fundamental metabolic processes. CoA is synthesized from pantothenic acid by a pathway that is largely conserved among bacteria and eukaryotes and consists of five enzymatic steps. While higher organisms, including humans, must scavenge pantothenate from the environment, most bacteria and plants are capable of de novo pantothenate biosynthesis. In Salmonella enterica, precursors to pantothenate can be salvaged, but subsequent intermediates are not transported due to their phosphorylated state, and thus the pathway from pantothenate to CoA is considered essential. Genetic analyses identified the STM4195 gene product of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium as a transporter of pantothenate precursors, ketopantoate and pantoate and, to a lesser extent, pantothenate. Further results indicated that STM4195 transports a product of CoA degradation that serves as a precursor to CoA and enters the biosynthetic pathway between PanC and CoaBC (dfp). The relevant CoA derivative is distinguishable from pantothenate, pantetheine, and pantethine and has spectral properties indicating the adenine moiety of CoA is intact. Taken together, the results presented here provide evidence of a transport mechanism for the uptake of ketopantoate, pantoate, and pantothenate and demonstrate a role for STM4195 in the salvage of a CoA derivative of unknown structure. The STM4195 gene is renamed panS to reflect participation in pantothenate salvage that was uncovered herein.|This manuscript describes a transporter for two pantothenate precursors in addition to the existence and transport of a salvageable coenzyme A (CoA) derivative. Specifically, these studies defined a function for an STM protein in S. enterica that was distinct from the annotated role and led to its designation as PanS (pantothenate salvage). The presence of a salvageable CoA derivative and a transporter for it suggests the possibility that this compound is present in the environment and may serve a role in CoA synthesis for some organisms. As such, this work raises important question about CoA salvage that can be pursued with future studies in bacteria and other organisms.},

The efficacy of pantethine treatment on cardiovascular risk markers was investigated in a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled study, in a low to moderate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk North American population eligible for statin therapy, using the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines. A total of 32 subjects were randomized to pantethine (600 mg/day from weeks 1 to 8 and 900 mg/day from weeks 9 to 16) or placebo. Compared with placebo, the participants on pantethine showed a significant decrease in total cholesterol at 16 weeks (P=0.040) and LDL-C at 8 and 16 weeks (P=0.020 and P=0.006, respectively), and decreasing trends in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at week 8 and week 12 (P=0.102 and P=0.145, respectively) that reached significance by week 16 (P=0.042). An 11% decrease in LDL-C from baseline was seen in participants on pantethine, at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16, while participants on placebo showed a 3% increase at week 16. This decrease was significant between groups at weeks 8 (P=0.027) and 16 (P=0.010). The homocysteine levels for both groups did not change significantly from baseline to week 16. Coenzyme Q10 significantly increased from baseline to week 4 and remained elevated until week 16, in both the pantethine and placebo groups. After 16 weeks, the participants on placebo did not show significant improvement in any CVD risk end points. This study confirms that pantethine lowers cardiovascular risk markers in low to moderate CVD risk participants eligible for statins according to NCEP guidelines.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The global burden of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has shown an upsurge in recent years due to the higher load of immunocompromised patients suffering from various diseases. The role of early and accurate diagnosis in the aggressive containment of the fungal infection at the initial stages becomes crucial thus, preventing the development of a life-threatening situation. With the changing demands of clinical mycology, the field of fungal diagnostics has evolved and come a long way from traditional methods of microscopy and culturing to more advanced non-culture-based tools. With the advent of more powerful approaches such as novel PCR assays, T2 Candida, microfluidic chip technology, next generation sequencing, new generation biosensors, nanotechnology-based tools, artificial intelligence-based models, the face of fungal diagnostics is constantly changing for the better. All these advances have been reviewed here giving the latest update to our readers in the most orderly flow. MAIN TEXT: A detailed literature survey was conducted by the team followed by data collection, pertinent data extraction, in-depth analysis, and composing the various sub-sections and the final review. The review is unique in its kind as it discusses the advances in molecular methods; advances in serology-based methods; advances in biosensor technology; and advances in machine learning-based models, all under one roof. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no review covering all of these fields (especially biosensor technology and machine learning using artificial intelligence) with relevance to invasive fungal infections. CONCLUSION: The review will undoubtedly assist in updating the scientific community's understanding of the most recent advancements that are on the horizon and that may be implemented as adjuncts to the traditional diagnostic algorithms.},

Therefore, IFD continue to be a public health threat and a major hindrance to the success of otherwise life-saving treatments and procedures. Globally, hundreds of thousands of people are affected every year with Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jirovecii, endemic dimorphic fungi and Mucormycetes, the most common fungal species causing invasive diseases in humans. These infections result in morbidity and mortality rates that are unacceptable and represent a considerable socioeconomic burden. Raising the general awareness of the significance and impact of IFD in human health, in both the hospital and the community, is hence critical to understand the scale of the problem and to raise interest to help fighting these devastating diseases.},

   abstract = {The fungal kingdom includes at least 6 million eukaryotic species and is remarkable with respect to its profound impact on global health, biodiversity, ecology, agriculture, manufacturing, and biomedical research. Approximately 625 fungal species have been reported to infect vertebrates, 200 of which can be human associated, either as commensals and members of our microbiome or as pathogens that cause infectious diseases. These organisms pose a growing threat to human health with the global increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections, prevalence of fungal allergy, and the evolution of fungal pathogens resistant to some or all current classes of antifungals. More broadly, there has been an unprecedented and worldwide emergence of fungal pathogens affecting animal and plant biodiversity. Approximately 8,000 species of fungi and Oomycetes are associated with plant disease. Indeed, across agriculture, such fungal diseases of plants include new devastating epidemics of trees and jeopardize food security worldwide by causing epidemics in staple and commodity crops that feed billions. Further, ingestion of mycotoxins contributes to ill health and causes cancer. Coordinated international research efforts, enhanced technology translation, and greater policy outreach by scientists are needed to more fully understand the biology and drivers that underlie the emergence of fungal diseases and to mitigate against their impacts. Here, we focus on poignant examples of emerging fungal threats in each of three areas: human health, wildlife biodiversity, and food security.},

   abstract = {Candida albicans is both a member of the healthy human microbiome and a major pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. Infections are typically treated with azole inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis often leading to drug resistance. Studies in clinical isolates have implicated multiple mechanisms in resistance, but have focused on large-scale aberrations or candidate genes, and do not comprehensively chart the genetic basis of adaptation. Here, we leveraged next-generation sequencing to analyze 43 isolates from 11 oral candidiasis patients. We detected newly selected mutations, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy-number variations and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. LOH events were commonly associated with acquired resistance, and SNPs in 240 genes may be related to host adaptation. Conversely, most aneuploidies were transient and did not correlate with drug resistance. Our analysis also shows that isolates also varied in adherence, filamentation, and virulence. Our work reveals new molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of drug resistance and host adaptation.},

The apbA gene was the first locus defined as required for function of the APB pathway (D. M. Downs and L. Petersen, J. Bacteriol. 176:4858-4864, 1994). Recent work showed the ApbA protein catalyzes the NADPH-specific reduction of ketopantoic acid to pantoic acid. This activity had previously been associated with the pantothenate biosynthetic gene panE. Although previous reports placed panE at 87 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome, we show herein that apbA and panE are allelic and map to 10 min on both the S. typhimurium and E. coli chromosomes. Results presented here suggest that the role of ApbA in thiamine synthesis is indirect since in vivo labeling studies showed that pantoic acid, the product of the ApbA-catalyzed reaction, is not a direct precursor to thiamine via the APB pathway.},

   abstract = {Within the budding yeasts, the opportunistic pathogen Candida glabrata and other members of the Nakaseomyces clade have developed virulence traits independently from C. albicans and C. auris To begin exploring the genetic basis of C. glabrata virulence and its innate resistance to antifungals, we launched the Hermes transposon from a plasmid and sequenced more than 500,000 different semi-random insertions throughout the genome. With machine learning, we identified 1278 protein-encoding genes (25% of total) that could not tolerate transposon insertions and are likely essential for C. glabrata fitness in vitro Interestingly, genes involved in mRNA splicing were less likely to be essential in C. glabrata than their orthologs in S. cerevisiae, whereas the opposite is true for genes involved in kinetochore function and chromosome segregation. When a pool of insertion mutants was challenged with the first-line antifungal fluconazole, insertions in several known resistance genes (e.g., PDR1, CDR1, PDR16, PDR17, UPC2A, DAP1, STV1) and 15 additional genes (including KGD1, KGD2, YHR045W) became hypersensitive to fluconazole. Insertions in 200 other genes conferred significant resistance to fluconazole, two-thirds of which function in mitochondria and likely down-regulate Pdr1 expression or function. Knockout mutants of KGD2 and IDH2, which consume and generate alpha-ketoglutarate in mitochondria, exhibited increased and decreased resistance to fluconazole through a process that depended on Pdr1. These findings establish the utility of transposon insertion profiling in forward genetic investigations of this important pathogen of humans.},

   abstract = {Candida, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus species are the most frequent cause of severe human fungal infections. Clinically relevant antifungal drugs are scarce, and their eﬀectiveness are hampered by the ability of fungal cells to develop drug resistance mechanisms. Drug eﬀectiveness and drug resistance in human pathogens is very often aﬀected by their “transportome”. Many studies have covered a panoply of drug resistance mechanisms that depend on drug eﬄux pumps belonging to the ATP-Binding Cassette and Major Facilitator Superfamily. However, the study of drug uptake mechanisms has been, to some extent, overlooked in pathogenic fungi. This review focuses on discussing current knowledge on drug uptake systems in fungal pathogens, highlighting the need for further studies on this topic of great importance. The following subjects are covered: (i) drugs imported by known transporter(s) in pathogenic fungi; and (ii) drugs imported by known transporter(s) in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or in human parasites, aimed at the identiﬁcation of their homologs in pathogenic fungi. Besides its contribution to increase the understanding of drug-pathogen interactions, the practical implications of identifying drug importers in human pathogens are discussed, particularly focusing on drug development strategies.},

Whereas some intracellular pathogens escape into the host cytosol, Histoplasma yeasts remain within the macrophage phagosome. This intracellular Histoplasma-containing compartment imposes nutritional challenges for yeast growth and replication. We identified and annotated vitamin synthesis pathways encoded in the Histoplasma genome and confirmed by growth in minimal medium that Histoplasma yeasts can synthesize all essential vitamins with the exception of thiamine. Riboflavin, pantothenate, and biotin auxotrophs of Histoplasma were generated to probe whether these vitamins are available to intracellular yeasts. Disruption of the RIB2 gene (riboflavin biosynthesis) prevented growth and proliferation of yeasts in macrophages and severely attenuated Histoplasma virulence in a murine model of respiratory histoplasmosis. Rib2-deficient yeasts were not cleared from lung tissue but persisted, consistent with functional survival mechanisms but inability to replicate in vivo. In addition, depletion of Pan6 (pantothenate biosynthesis) but not Bio2 function (biotin synthesis) also impaired Histoplasma virulence. These results indicate that the Histoplasma-containing phagosome is limiting for riboflavin and pantothenate and that Histoplasma virulence requires de novo synthesis of these cofactor precursors. Since mammalian hosts do not rely on vitamin synthesis but instead acquire essential vitamins through diet, vitamin synthesis pathways represent druggable targets for therapeutics.},

   abstract = {Coenzyme A (CoA) holds a central position in cellular metabolism and therefore can be assumed to be an ancient molecule. Starting from the known E. coli and human enzymes required for the biosynthesis of CoA, phylogenetic profiles and chromosomal proximity methods enabled an almost complete reconstruction of archaeal CoA biosynthesis. This includes the identification of strong candidates for archaeal pantothenate synthetase and pantothenate kinase, which are unrelated to the corresponding bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes. According to this reconstruction, the topology of CoA synthesis from common precursors is essentially conserved across the three domains of life. The CoA pathway is conserved to varying degrees in eukaryotic pathogens like Giardia lamblia or Plasmodium falciparum, indicating that these pathogens have individual uptake-mechanisms for different CoA precursors. Phylogenetic analysis and phyletic distribution of the CoA biosynthetic enzymes suggest that the enzymes required for the synthesis of phosphopantothenate were recruited independently in the bacterial and archaeal lineages by convergent evolution, and that eukaryotes inherited the genes for the synthesis of pantothenate (vitamin B5) from bacteria. Homologues to bacterial enzymes involved in pantothenate biosynthesis are present in a subset of archaeal genomes. The phylogenies of these enzymes indicate that they were acquired from bacterial thermophiles through horizontal gene transfer. Monophyly can be inferred for each of the enzymes catalyzing the four ultimate steps of CoA synthesis, the conversion of phosphopantothenate into CoA. The results support the notion that CoA was initially synthesized from a prebiotic precursor, most likely pantothenate or a related compound.},

   abstract = {Novel drug targets are required in order to design new defenses against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Comparative genomics provides new opportunities for finding optimal targets among previously unexplored cellular functions, based on an understanding of related biological processes in bacterial pathogens and their hosts. We describe an integrated approach to identification and prioritization of broad-spectrum drug targets. Our strategy is based on genetic footprinting in Escherichia coli followed by metabolic context analysis of essential gene orthologs in various species. Genes required for viability of E. coli in rich medium were identified on a whole-genome scale using the genetic footprinting technique. Potential target pathways were deduced from these data and compared with a panel of representative bacterial pathogens by using metabolic reconstructions from genomic data. Conserved and indispensable functions revealed by this analysis potentially represent broad-spectrum antibacterial targets. Further target prioritization involves comparison of the corresponding pathways and individual functions between pathogens and the human host. The most promising targets are validated by direct knockouts in model pathogens. The efficacy of this approach is illustrated using examples from metabolism of adenylate cofactors NAD(P), coenzyme A, and flavin adenine dinucleotide. Several drug targets within these pathways, including three distantly related adenylyltransferases (orthologs of the E. coli genes nadD, coaD, and ribF), are discussed in detail.},

The relative contribution of the SMVT system toward carrier-mediated biotin uptake in the native intestine in vivo has not been established. We used a Cre/lox technology to generate an intestine-specific (conditional) SMVT knockout (KO) mouse model to address this issue. The KO mice exhibited absence of expression of SMVT in the intestine compared with sex-matched littermates as well as the expected normal SMVT expression in other tissues. About two-thirds of the KO mice died prematurely between the age of 6 and 10 wk. Growth retardation, decreased bone density, decreased bone length, and decreased biotin status were observed in the KO mice. Microscopic analysis showed histological abnormalities in the small bowel (shortened villi, dysplasia) and cecum (chronic active inflammation, dysplasia) of the KO mice. In vivo (and in vitro) transport studies showed complete inhibition in carrier-mediated biotin uptake in the intestine of the KO mice compared with their control littermates. These studies provide the first in vivo confirmation in native intestine that SMVT is solely responsible for intestinal biotin uptake. These studies also provide evidence for a casual association between SMVT function and normal intestinal health.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of IRAEs during the first week of systemic amphotericin B therapy and to identify pretreatment regimens that are effective in preventing these IRAEs. Three hundred ninety-seven adult inpatients receiving amphotericin B therapy were prospectively monitored, and data regarding IRAEs and pretreatment regimens were collected. Of these patients, 282 (71%) developed at least one IRAE during the first 7 days of therapy. The IRAEs most commonly reported were fever (51% of patients) and chills (28%), followed by nausea (18%), headache (9%), and thrombophlebitis (5%). The most common regimens included diphenhydramine, a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and heparin, administered alone or in combination with these or other drugs. Overall, common pretreatment regimens were similar in efficacy to no pretreatment in the prevention of IRAEs. Thus empirical premedication for IRAEs associated with amphotericin B cannot be routinely advocated; instead, patients should be treated when symptoms first arise and then premedicated for subsequent amphotericin B infusions.},

This sensitivity is gained by making use of an established thiol-derivatisation agent that produces a fluorophore upon labeling, which is subsequently separated by HPLC and quantified by fluorescence detection. While previous reports have made use of a similar strategy to quantify CoA, very few have extended the method to the CoA biosynthetic intermediates (some of which occur at levels much lower than CoA) or have critically evaluated its analytical performance. In this study we addressed these shortcomings, and also overcame the difficulty associated with the independent confirmation of the concentrations of the analytical standards used for quantification. The method's utility is showcased through time-course analyses of   in vitro   reconstituted enzyme reactions and by analysis of extracts from   Escherichia coli   and   Staphylococcus aureus  , demonstrating its potential in advancing studies of CoA biosynthesis and CoA-dependent biology in a wide range of systems.},

   abstract = {In a diverse family of cellular cofactors, coenzyme A (CoA) has a unique design to function in various biochemical processes. The presence of a highly reactive thiol group and a nucleotide moiety offers a diversity of chemical reactions and regulatory interactions. CoA employs them to activate carbonyl-containing molecules and to produce various thioester derivatives (e.g. acetyl CoA, malonyl CoA and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA), which have well-established roles in cellular metabolism, production of neurotransmitters and the regulation of gene expression. A novel unconventional function of CoA in redox regulation, involving covalent attachment of this coenzyme to cellular proteins in response to oxidative and metabolic stress, has been recently discovered and termed protein CoAlation (S-thiolation by CoA or CoAthiolation). A diverse range of proteins was found to be CoAlated in mammalian cells and tissues under various experimental conditions. Protein CoAlation alters the molecular mass, charge and activity of modified proteins, and prevents them from irreversible sulfhydryl overoxidation. This review highlights the role of a key metabolic integrator CoA in redox regulation in mammalian cells and provides a perspective of the current status and future directions of the emerging field of protein CoAlation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by dystonia, parkinsonism, and iron accumulation in the brain. Many patients with this disease have mutations in the gene encoding pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2); these patients are said to have pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. In this study, we compared the clinical and radiographic features of patients with Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome with and without mutations in PANK2. METHODS: One hundred twenty-three patients from 98 families with a diagnosis of Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome were classified on the basis of clinical assessment as having classic disease (characterized by early onset with rapid progression) or atypical disease (later onset with slow progression). Their genomic DNA was sequenced for PANK2 mutations. RESULTS: All patients with classic Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome and one third of those with atypical disease had PANK2 mutations. Whereas almost all mutations in patients with atypical disease led to amino acid changes, those in patients with classic disease more often resulted in predicted protein truncation. Patients with atypical disease who had PANK2 mutations were more likely to have prominent speech-related and psychiatric symptoms than patients with classic disease or mutation-negative patients with atypical disease. In all patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, whether classic or atypical, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a specific pattern of hyperintensity within the hypointense medial globus pallidus. This pattern was not seen in any patients without mutations. CONCLUSIONS: PANK2 mutations are associated with all cases of classic Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome and one third of cases of atypical disease. A specific MRI pattern distinguishes patients with PANK2 mutations. Predicted levels of pantothenate kinase 2 protein correlate with the severity of disease.},

   abstract = {Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole that is active against aspergillus species. We conducted a randomized trial to compare voriconazole with amphotericin B for primary therapy of invasive aspergillosis.|In this randomized, unblinded trial, patients received either intravenous voriconazole (two doses of 6 mg per kilogram of body weight on day 1, then 4 mg per kilogram twice daily for at least seven days) followed by 200 mg orally twice daily or intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 to 1.5 mg per kilogram per day). Other licensed antifungal treatments were allowed if the initial therapy failed or if the patient had an intolerance to the first drug used. A complete or partial response was considered to be a successful outcome.|A total of 144 patients in the voriconazole group and 133 patients in the amphotericin B group with definite or probable aspergillosis received at least one dose of treatment. In most of the patients, the underlying condition was allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation, acute leukemia, or other hematologic diseases. At week 12, there were successful outcomes in 52.8 percent of the patients in the voriconazole group (complete responses in 20.8 percent and partial responses in 31.9 percent) and 31.6 percent of those in the amphotericin B group (complete responses in 16.5 percent and partial responses in 15.0 percent; absolute difference, 21.2 percentage points; 95 percent confidence interval, 10.4 to 32.9). The survival rate at 12 weeks was 70.8 percent in the voriconazole group and 57.9 percent in the amphotericin B group (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.88). Voriconazole-treated patients had significantly fewer severe drug-related adverse events, but transient visual disturbances were common with voriconazole (occurring in 44.8 percent of patients).|In patients with invasive aspergillosis, initial therapy with voriconazole led to better responses and improved survival and resulted in fewer severe side effects than the standard approach of initial therapy with amphotericin B.},

Candida krusei candidemia was most commonly associated with prior use of antifungal agents (70.6%; P<.001), hematologic malignancy (52.9%; P<.001) or stem cell transplantation (17.7%; P<.001), neutropenia (45.1%; P<.001), and corticosteroid treatment (60.8%; P<.001). Patients with C. krusei candidemia had the highest crude 12-week mortality in this series (52.9%; P<.001). Fluconazole was the most commonly administered antimicrobial, followed by the echinocandins, and amphotericin B products were infrequently administered.|The epidemiology and choice of therapy for candidemia are rapidly changing.

   abstract = {Pulmonary cryptococcosis describes an invasive lung mycosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii complex. It is often a high-consequence disease in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent populations, and may be misdiagnosed as pulmonary malignancy, leading to a delay in therapy. Epidemiology follows that of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, with C. gattii infection more common in certain geographic regions. Diagnostic tools include histopathology, microscopy and culture, and the detection of cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen or Cryptococcus-derived nucleic acids. All patients with lung cryptococcosis should have a lumbar puncture and cerebral imaging to exclude central nervous system disease. Radiology is key, both as an adjunct to laboratory testing and as the initial means of detection in asymptomatic patients or those with non-specific symptoms. Pulmonary cryptococcomas (single or multiple) may also be associated with disseminated disease and/or cryptococcal meningitis, requiring prolonged treatment regimens. Optimal management for severe disease requires extended induction (amphotericin B and flucytosine) and consolidation therapy (fluconazole) with close clinical monitoring. Susceptibility testing is of value for epidemiology and in regions where relatively high minimum inhibitory concentrations to azoles (particularly fluconazole) have been noted. Novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents promise to improve the detection and treatment of cryptococcosis, particularly in low-income settings where the disease burden is high.},

   abstract = {Cryptococcus spp., in particular Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, have an enormous impact on human health worldwide. The global burden of cryptococcal meningitis is almost a quarter of a million cases and 181,000 deaths annually, with mortality rates of 100% if infections remain untreated. Despite these alarming statistics, treatment options for cryptococcosis remain limited, with only three major classes of drugs approved for clinical use. Exacerbating the public health burden is the fact that the only new class of antifungal drugs developed in decades, the echinocandins, displays negligible antifungal activity against Cryptococcus spp., and the efficacy of the remaining therapeutics is hampered by host toxicity and pathogen resistance. Here, we describe the current arsenal of antifungal agents and the treatment strategies employed to manage cryptococcal disease. We further elaborate on the recent advances in our understanding of the intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that are utilized by Cryptococcus spp. to evade therapeutic treatments. Finally, we review potential therapeutic strategies, including combination therapy, the targeting of virulence traits, impairing stress response pathways and modulating host immunity, to effectively treat infections caused by Cryptococcus spp. Overall, understanding of the mechanisms that regulate anti-cryptococcal drug resistance, coupled with advances in genomics technologies and high-throughput screening methodologies, will catalyse innovation and accelerate antifungal drug discovery.},

The panF gene was isolated from an Escherichia coli genomic DNA library and subcloned into multicopy plasmids. Increased copy number of the panF+ allele resulted in increased rates of pantothenate uptake and a significant increase in the steady-state intracellular pantothenate concentration. Despite the higher levels of pantothenate, the utilization of pantothenate for coenzyme A formation was not elevated, indicating that pantothenate kinase activity is the dominant regulator of coenzyme A biosynthesis. DNA sequencing of the panF gene revealed the presence of a single open reading frame that encoded a hydrophobic protein with a molecular weight of 51,992. Sequence analysis predicts that pantothenate permease is an integral membrane protein possessing 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains connected by short hydrophilic sequences. The predicted topological profile of pantothenate permease is similar to that of other membrane carriers that catalyze cation-dependent symport.},

The intracellular content of acyl carrier protein was relatively insensitive to beta-alanine input, whereas the CoA content increased as a function of external beta-alanine concentration, reaching a maximum at 8 microM beta-alanine. Further increase in the beta-alanine concentration led to the excretion of pantothenate into the medium. Comparing the amount of pantothenate found outside the cell to the level of intracellular metabolites demonstrates that E. coli is capable of producing 15-fold more pantoic acid than is required to maintain the intracellular CoA content. Therefore, the supply of pantoic acid is not a limiting factor in CoA biosynthesis. Wild-type cells also excreted pantothenate into the medium, showing that the beta-alanine supply is also not rate limiting in CoA biogenesis. Taken together, the results point to pantothenate kinase as the primary enzymatic step that regulates the CoA content of E. coli.},

From January 1980 through April 1990, 27,200 fungal isolates causing nosocomial infections were reported from these hospitals; Candida species accounted for 19,621 (72.1%) of these isolates. Immunocompromised patients are at particularly high risk for candidemia. In patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, treatment with vancomycin and/or imipenem appears to be an independent risk factor for candidemia; colonization of stool by Candida species may be another important predisposing factor in these patients. Rapid detection of invasive candidemia in these high-risk patients is particularly important to the improvement of rates of survival. Methods for rapid detection, such as the measurement of mannan (the major cell-wall polysaccharide of Candida), may be useful for diagnosing invasive candidiasis and for monitoring the response of this infection to antifungal therapy. Further studies of risk factors and the development of new methods for rapid diagnosis and monitoring should help decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with nosocomial fungal infections.},

   abstract = {Infections caused by Aspergillus spp. remain associated with high morbidity and mortality. While mold-active antifungal prophylaxis has led to a decrease of occurrence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in those patients most at risk for infection, breakthrough IA does occur and remains difficult to diagnose due to low sensitivities of mycological tests for IA. IA is also increasingly observed in other non-neutropenic patient groups, where clinical presentation is atypical and diagnosis remains challenging. Early and targeted systemic antifungal treatment remains the most important predictive factor for a successful outcome in immunocompromised individuals. Recent guidelines recommend voriconazole and/or isavuconazole for the primary treatment of IA, with liposomal amphotericin B being the first alternative, and posaconazole, as well as echinocandins, primarily recommended for salvage treatment. Few studies have evaluated treatment options for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), where long-term oral itraconazole or voriconazole remain the treatment of choice.},

   abstract = {During the past decade, the incidence of Candida infections in hospitalized patients has increased, with fluconazole being the most commonly prescribed systemic antifungal agent for these infections. However, the 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) candidiasis guidelines recommend an echinocandin for the treatment of candidemia/invasive candidiasis in patients who are considered to be "moderately severe or severely" ill. To validate these guidelines, clinical trial data were reviewed.|A secondary analysis of data from a previously published prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed; it compared anidulafungin with fluconazole for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and candidemia. Patients with critical illness were identified at study entry by using the following criteria: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score of ≥ 15, evidence of severe sepsis (sepsis and one or more end-organ dysfunctions) present, and/or patient was in intensive care. Global response rates were compared at the end of intravenous study treatment (the primary end point of the original study) and all-cause mortality at 14 and 28 days from study entry in this group.|The patients (163 (66.5%) of 245) fulfilled at least one criterion for critical illness (anidulafungin, n = 89; fluconazole, n = 74). No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics between the two treatment groups. The global response rate was 70.8% for anidulafungin and 54.1% for fluconazole (P = 0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0 to 31.5); all-cause mortality was 10.1% versus 20.3% at 14 days (P = 0.08; 95% CI, -0.9 to 21.3) and was 20.2% versus 24.3% at 28 days (P = 0.57; 95% CI, -8.8 to 17.0) for anidulafungin and fluconazole, respectively.|In this post hoc analysis, anidulafungin was more effective than fluconazole for treatment of severely ill patients with candidemia, thus supporting the 2009 IDSA guidelines.|Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00058682.},

Several techniques of cell wall disintegration were studied, including ultrasound disintegration, homogenization in bead mill, application of chemicals of various types, and osmotic shock. The release of proteins from fungal cells and the activity of a cytosolic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, in the crude extracts were assayed to determine and compare the efficacy of each method. The presented studies allowed adjusting the particular method to a particular strain. The mechanical methods of disintegration appeared to be the most effective for the disintegration of yeast, R. gracilis, and filamentous fungi, A. fumigatus and P. citrinum. Ultrasonication and bead milling led to obtaining fungal cell-free extracts containing high concentrations of soluble proteins and active glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase systems.},

   abstract = {A dominant assumption in pharmacology throughout the 20th century has been that in vivo target occupancy-and attendant pharmacodynamics-depends on the systemic concentration of drug relative to the equilibrium dissociation constant for the drug-target complex. In turn, the duration of pharmacodynamics is temporally linked to the systemic pharmacokinetics of the drug. Yet, there are many examples of drugs for which pharmacodynamic effect endures long after the systemic concentration of a drug has waned to (equilibrium) insignificant levels. To reconcile such data, the drug-target residence time model was formulated, positing that it is the lifetime (or residence time) of the binary drug-target complex, and not its equilibrium affinity per se, that determines the extent and duration of drug pharmacodynamics. Here, we review this model, its evolution over time, and its applications to natural ligand-macromolecule biology and synthetic drug-target pharmacology.},

This multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority study compared voriconazole with a regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole for the treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients.|Non-neutropenic patients with a positive blood culture for a species of candida and clinical evidence of infection were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, either voriconazole (n=283) or amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (n=139). The primary efficacy analysis was based on clinical and mycological response 12 weeks after the end of treatment, assessed by an independent data-review committee unaware of treatment assignment.|Of 422 patients randomised, 370 were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. Voriconazole was non-inferior to amphotericin B/fluconazole in the primary efficacy analysis, with successful outcomes in 41% of patients in both treatment groups (95% CI for difference -10.6% to 10.6%). At the last evaluable assessment, outcome was successful in 162 (65%) patients assigned voriconazole and 87 (71%) assigned amphotericin B/fluconazole (p=0.25). Voriconazole cleared blood cultures as quickly as amphotericin B/fluconazole (median time to negative blood culture, 2.0 days). Treatment discontinuations due to all-cause adverse events were more frequent in the voriconazole group, although most discontinuations were due to non-drug-related events and there were significantly fewer serious adverse events and cases of renal toxicity than in the amphotericin B/fluconazole group.|Voriconazole was as effective as the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in the treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients, and with fewer toxic effects.|There are several options for treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients, including amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole, and echinocandins.

The overall burden of invasive candidiasis remains high, particularly in the expanding populations of patients at risk of opportunistic infection, such as the elderly or immunosuppressed. Progressive shifts from Candida albicans to non-albicans Candida spp. have been observed globally. The recent emergence of novel, multiresistant species, such as Candida auris, amplifies the call for vigilance in detection and advances in treatment. Among the current treatment options, fluconazole is still widely used throughout the world. Increased resistance to fluconazole, both acquired and naturally emerging, has been observed. Resistance to echinocandins is presently low but this may change with increased use. Improvement of diagnostic techniques and strategies, development of international surveillance networks and implementation of antifungal stewardship programmes represent major challenges for a better epidemiological control of invasive candidiasis.},

   abstract = {The key regulatory step in CoA biosynthesis in bacteria and mammals is pantothenate kinase (CoaA), which governs the intracellular concentration of CoA through feedback regulation by CoA and its thioesters. CoaA from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCoaA) has a distinct primary sequence that is more similar to the mammalian pantothenate kinases than the prototypical bacterial CoaA of Escherichia coli. In contrast to all known pantothenate kinases, SaCoaA activity is not feedback-regulated by CoA or CoA thioesters. Metabolic labeling of S. aureus confirms that CoA levels are not controlled by CoaA or at steps downstream from CoaA. The pantothenic acid antimetabolite N-heptylpantothenamide (N7-Pan) possesses potent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and has multiple cellular targets. N7-Pan is a substrate for SaCoaA and is converted to the inactive butyldethia-CoA analog by the downstream pathway enzymes. The analog is also incorporated into acyl carrier protein and D-alanyl carrier protein, the prosthetic groups of which are derived from CoA. The inactivation of acyl carrier protein and the cessation of fatty acid synthesis are the most critical causes of growth inhibition by N7-Pan because the toxicity of the drug is ameliorated by supplementing the growth medium with fatty acids. The absence of feedback regulation at the pantothenate kinase step allows the accumulation of high concentrations of intracellular CoA, consistent with the physiology of S. aureus, which lacks glutathione and relies on the CoA/CoA disulfide reductase redox system for protection from oxidative damage.},

   abstract = {Pantothenate is vitamin B5 and is the key precursor for the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a universal and essential cofactor involved in a myriad of metabolic reactions, including the synthesis of phospholipids, the synthesis and degradation of fatty acids, and the operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. CoA is also the only source of the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group for enzymes that shuttle intermediates between the active sites of enzymes involved in fatty acid, nonribosomal peptide, and polyketide synthesis. Pantothenate can be synthesized de novo and/or transported into the cell through a pantothenatepermease. Pantothenate uptake is essential for those organisms that lack the genes to synthesize this vitamin. The intracellular levels of CoA are controlled by the balance between synthesis and degradation. In particular, CoA is assembled in five enzymatic steps, starting from the phosphorylation of pantothenate to phosphopantothenatecatalyzed by pantothenate kinase, the product of the coaA gene. In some bacteria, the production of phosphopantothenate by pantothenate kinase is the rate limiting and most regulated step in the biosynthetic pathway. CoA synthesis additionally networks with other vitamin-associated pathways, such as thiamine and folic acid.},

In the last few years, all of the genes encoding the CoA biosynthetic enzymes have been identified and the structures of several proteins in the pathway have been determined. CoA is assembled in five steps from pantothenic acid and pathway intermediates are common to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In spite of the identical biochemistry, remarkable sequence differences among some of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes have been revealed by comparative genomics. Renewed interest in CoA has arisen from the realization that the biosynthetic pathway is a target for antibacterial drug discovery and from the unexpected association of a human neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in pantothenate kinase. The purpose of this review is to integrate previous knowledge with the most recent findings in the genetics, enzymology and regulation of CoA biosynthesis in bacteria, plants and mammals.},

The major target for resistance mutations involves the Cyp51A gene, encoding an enzyme involved in cell wall synthesis. Triazole-resistance selection environments include patient treatment and organic matter containing triazole fungicide residues. Reported resistance frequencies vary widely between countries and hospitals, and resistance significantly complicates the diagnosis and treatment of Aspergillus diseases. Cultures may harbour various resistance phenotypes and multiple colonies must be analysed to detect resistance. PCR tests have become available for resistance detection in culture-negative patients, but show limited sensitivity. Individuals with triazole-resistant invasive aspergillosis have a 21% higher day-42 mortality compared with triazole-susceptible infection, and to prevent excess mortality resistant cases require first-line therapy that covers resistance. The recent ESCMID-ECMM-ERS Aspergillus guideline recommends resistance testing in A. fumigatus and local resistance surveillance. If resistance rates exceed 10% liposomal amphotericin B or triazole and echinocandin first-line therapy should be considered.|Triazole resistance significantly complicates the management of aspergillosis and multidisciplinary research from a 'One-health' perspective is required to retain the triazole class for medical use.},

In vitro and animal model data provide useful insights into the activity, appropriate dose, and potential role of these agents in invasive aspergillosis. These studies reveal a potentially concerning lack of tissue sterilization when echinocandins are used as monotherapy but clearly show improved survival with increasing doses. Furthermore pharmacodynamic studies suggest that echinocandin doses currently in widespread clinical use may optimize outcomes in invasive aspergillosis. A paucity of clinical data exists examining these agents as monotherapy for invasive aspergillosis and virtually no clinical data exists for using these agents as primary therapy. Further data examining the role of echinocandin monotherapy for invasive aspergillosis is unlikely to be forthcoming in the foreseeable future due to several factors including the aforementioned issues, the relatively small number patients with this infection, and the belief that these agents are potentially best used as part of combination therapy regimens for invasive aspergillosis.},

The 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method.

   abstract = {Until the 1940s, relatively few agents were available for the treatment of systemic fungal infections. The development of the polyene antifungals represented a major advance in medical mycology. Although amphotericin B quickly became the mainstay of therapy for serious infections, its use was associated with infusion-related side-effects and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. The continued search for new and less toxic antifungals led to the discovery of the azoles several decades later. Ketoconazole, the first available compound for the oral treatment of systemic fungal infections, was released in the early 1980s. For almost a decade, ketoconazole was regarded as the drug of choice in nonlife-threatening endemic mycoses. The introduction of the first-generation triazoles represented a second major advance in the treatment of fungal infections. Both fluconazole and itraconazole displayed a broader spectrum of antifungal activity than the imidazoles and had a markedly improved safety profile compared with amphotericin B and ketoconazole. Despite widespread use, however, these agents became subject to a number of clinically important limitations related to their suboptimal spectrum of activity, the development of resistance, the induction of hazardous drug-drug interactions, their less than optimal pharmacokinetic profile (itraconazole capsules), and toxicity. In order to overcome these limitations, several analogues have been developed. These so-called 'second-generation' triazoles, including voriconazole, posaconazole and ravuconazole, have greater potency and possess increased activity against resistant and emerging pathogens, in particular against Aspergillus spp. If the toxicity profile of these agents is comparable to or better than that of the first-generation triazoles and drug interactions remain manageable, then these compounds represent a true expansion of our antifungal arsenal.},

   abstract = {The purification of coagulation proteins from plasma milieu is a complex and sometimes difficult task. Most clotting factors are present in plasma in trace amounts. They are sensitive to proteolytic degradation and adsorption to surfaces. Thus for most coagulation proteins it was not until the seventies that highly purified preparations were available. Nowadays, most coagulation proteins are isolated from plasma using combinations of ion exchange, molecular sieve and affinity chromatographies. Sometimes, e.g. for Vitamin K dependent factors, specific adsorption properties are utilized. During affinity chromatography, proteins may be bound to specific immobilized receptors, antibodies, substrates, or inhibitors. An example for the latter is the use of bezamidine-Sepharose for the purification of thrombin. Immunoadsorption to immobilized monoclonal antibodies allowed the isolation of highly purified factor VIII:C. For factor XI and prekallikrein the binding of these proteins to the immobilized cofactor high molecular weight kininogen is utilized for an effective separation of contaminations. Antithrombin III can be isolated by linkage to its cofactor, heparin, on heparin-Sepharose. Using affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose it is possible to isolate plasminogen from plasma, serum or urine in a one step procedure with high yield and quality. This, of course, is an ideal situation, where the goal of a purification, namely the separation of a highly purified, biologically active product with high yield can be accomplished in a simple, fast procedure.},

   abstract = {The large increase in the population of immunosuppressed patients, coupled with the limited efficacy of existing antifungals and rising resistance toward them, have dramatically highlighted the need to develop novel drugs for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. An attractive possibility is the identification of possible drug targets within essential fungal metabolic pathways not shared with humans. Here, we review the vitamin biosynthetic pathways (vitamins A(-)E, K) as candidates for the development of antifungals. We present a set of ranking criteria that identify the vitamin B2 (riboflavin), B5 (pantothenic acid), and B9 (folate) biosynthesis pathways as being particularly rich in new antifungal targets. We propose that recent scientific advances in the fields of drug design and fungal genomics have developed sufficiently to merit a renewed look at these pathways as promising sources for the development of novel classes of antifungals.},

   abstract = {Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor in all living organisms. It is involved in a large number of biochemical processes functioning either as an activator of molecules with carbonyl groups or as a carrier of acyl moieties. Together with its thioester derivatives, it plays a central role in cell metabolism, post-translational modification, and gene expression. Furthermore, recent studies revealed a role for CoA in the redox regulation by the S-thiolation of cysteine residues in cellular proteins. The intracellular concentration and distribution in different cellular compartments of CoA and its derivatives are controlled by several extracellular stimuli such as nutrients, hormones, metabolites, and cellular stresses. Perturbations of the biosynthesis and homeostasis of CoA and/or acyl-CoA are connected with several pathological conditions, including cancer, myopathies, and cardiomyopathies. In the most recent years, defects in genes involved in CoA production and distribution have been found in patients affected by rare forms of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review, we will summarize the most relevant aspects of CoA cellular metabolism, their role in the pathogenesis of selected neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and recent advancements in the search for therapeutic approaches for such diseases.},

Our aim is to help scientists whose research may be relevant to drug discovery and/or development to frame their research report in a way that appropriately places their findings within the drug discovery and development process and thereby support effective translation of preclinical research to humans. One overall theme of our article is that the process is sufficiently long, complex, and expensive so that many biological targets must be considered for every new medicine eventually approved for clinical use and new research tools may be needed to investigate each new target. Studies that contribute to solving any of the many scientific and operational issues involved in the development process can improve the efficiency of the process. An awareness of these issues allows the early implementation of measures to increase the opportunity for success. As editors of the journal, we encourage submission of research reports that provide data relevant to the issues presented.},

   abstract = {Caspofungin is an echinocandin agent with fungicidal activity against candida species. We performed a double-blind trial to compare caspofungin with amphotericin B deoxycholate for the primary treatment of invasive candidiasis.|We enrolled patients who had clinical evidence of infection and a positive culture for candida species from blood or another site. Patients were stratified according to the severity of disease, as indicated by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, and the presence or absence of neutropenia and were randomly assigned to receive either caspofungin or amphotericin B. The study was designed to compare the efficacy of caspofungin with that of amphotericin B in patients with invasive candidiasis and in a subgroup with candidemia.|Of the 239 patients enrolled, 224 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Base-line characteristics, including the percentage of patients with neutropenia and the mean APACHE II score, were similar in the two treatment groups. A modified intention-to-treat analysis showed that the efficacy of caspofungin was similar to that of amphotericin B, with successful outcomes in 73.4 percent of the patients treated with caspofungin and in 61.7 percent of those treated with amphotericin B (difference after adjustment for APACHE II score and neutropenic status, 12.7 percentage points; 95.6 percent confidence interval, -0.7 to 26.0). An analysis of patients who met prespecified criteria for evaluation showed that caspofungin was superior, with a favorable response in 80.7 percent of patients, as compared with 64.9 percent of those who received amphotericin B (difference, 15.4 percentage points; 95.6 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 29.7). Caspofungin was as effective as amphotericin B in patients who had candidemia, with a favorable response in 71.7 percent and 62.8 percent of patients, respectively (difference, 10.0 percentage points; 95.0 percent confidence interval, -4.5 to 24.5). There were significantly fewer drug-related adverse events in the caspofungin group than in the amphotericin B group.|Caspofungin is at least as effective as amphotericin B for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and, more specifically, candidemia.},

   abstract = {A novel type of antibacterial screening method, a target mechanism-based whole-cell screening method, was developed to combine the advantages of target mechanism- and whole-cell-based approaches. A mycobacterial reporter strain with a synthetic phenotype for caseinolytic protease (ClpP1P2) activity was engineered, allowing the detection of inhibitors of this enzyme inside intact bacilli. A high-throughput screening method identified bortezomib, a human 26S proteasome drug, as a potent inhibitor of ClpP1P2 activity and bacterial growth. A battery of secondary assays was employed to demonstrate that bortezomib indeed exerts its antimicrobial activity via inhibition of ClpP1P2: Down- or upmodulation of the intracellular protease level resulted in hyper- or hyposensitivity of the bacteria, the drug showed specific potentiation of translation error-inducing aminoglycosides, ClpP1P2-specific substrate WhiB1 accumulated upon exposure, and growth inhibition potencies of bortezomib derivatives correlated with ClpP1P2 inhibition potencies. Furthermore, molecular modeling showed that the drug can bind to the catalytic sites of ClpP1P2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of target mechanism-based whole-cell screening, provides chemical validation of ClpP1P2 as a target, and identifies a drug in clinical use as a new lead compound for tuberculosis therapy. IMPORTANCE: During the last decade, antibacterial drug discovery relied on biochemical assays, rather than whole-cell approaches, to identify molecules that interact with purified target proteins derived by genomics. This approach failed to deliver antibacterial compounds with whole-cell activity, either because of cell permeability issues that medicinal chemistry cannot easily fix or because genomic data of essentiality insufficiently predicted the vulnerability of the target identified. As a consequence, the field largely moved back to a whole-cell approach whose main limitation is its black-box nature, i.e., that it requires trial-and-error chemistry because the cellular target is unknown. We developed a novel type of antibacterial screening method, target mechanism-based whole-cell screening, to combine the advantages of both approaches. We engineered a mycobacterial reporter strain with a synthetic phenotype allowing us to identify inhibitors of the caseinolytic protease (ClpP1P2) inside the cell. This approach identified bortezomib, an anticancer drug, as a specific inhibitor of ClpP1P2. We further confirmed the specific "on-target" activity of bortezomib by independent approaches including, but not limited to, genetic manipulation of the target level (over- and underexpressing strains) and by establishing a dynamic structure-activity relationship between ClpP1P2 and growth inhibition. Identifying an "on-target" compound is critical to optimize the efficacy of the compound without compromising its specificity. This work demonstrates the feasibility of target mechanism-based whole-cell screening methods, validates ClpP1P2 as a druggable target, and delivers a lead compound for tuberculosis therapy.},

   abstract = {Fungal infections are rising all over the world every year. There are only five medical compound classes for treatment: triazoles, echinocandins, polyenes, flucytosine and allylamine. Currently, echinocandins are the most important compounds, because of their wide activity spectrum and much lower sides effects that may occur during therapy with other drugs. Echinocandins are secondary metabolites of fungi, which can inhibit the biosynthesis of β-(1,3)-D-glucan. These compounds have fungicidal and fungistatic activity depending on different genera of fungi, against which they are used. Echinocandin resistance is rare-the major cause of resistance is mutations in the gene encoding the β-(1,3)-D-glucan synthase enzyme. In this review of the literature we have summarized the characteristics of echinocandins, the mechanism of their antifungal activity with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and the resistance issue.},

   abstract = {Conventional tools for elucidating gene function are relatively scarce in Candida albicans, the most prevalent human fungal pathogen. To this end, we developed a convenient system to control gene expression in C. albicans by the tetracycline-regulatable (TR) promoters. When the sea pansy Renilla reniformis luciferase gene (RLUC1) was placed under the control of this system, doxycycline (DOX) inhibited the luciferase activity almost completely. In the absence of DOX, the RLUC1 gene was induced to express luciferase at a level 400- to 1,000-fold higher than that in the presence of DOX. The same results were obtained in hypha-forming cells. The replacement of N-myristoyltransferase or translation elongation factor 3 promoters with TR promoters conferred a DOX-dependent growth defect in culture media. Furthermore, all the mice infected with these mutants, which are still virulent, survived following DOX administration. Consistently, we observed that the number of these mutant cells recovered from the mouse kidneys was significantly reduced following DOX administration. Thus, this system is useful for investigating gene functions, since this system is able to function in both in vitro and in vivo settings.},

   abstract = {Coenzyme A (CoA) is the predominant acyl carrier in mammalian cells and a cofactor that plays a key role in energy and lipid metabolism. CoA and its thioesters (acyl-CoAs) regulate a multitude of metabolic processes at different levels: as substrates, allosteric modulators, and via post-translational modification of histones and other non-histone proteins. Evidence is emerging that synthesis and degradation of CoA are regulated in a manner that enables metabolic flexibility in different subcellular compartments. Degradation of CoA occurs through distinct intra- and extracellular pathways that rely on the activity of specific hydrolases. The pantetheinase enzymes specifically hydrolyze pantetheine to cysteamine and pantothenate, the last step in the extracellular degradation pathway for CoA. This reaction releases pantothenate in the bloodstream, making this CoA precursor available for cellular uptake and de novo CoA synthesis. Intracellular degradation of CoA depends on specific mitochondrial and peroxisomal Nudix hydrolases. These enzymes are also active against a subset of acyl-CoAs and play a key role in the regulation of subcellular (acyl-)CoA pools and CoA-dependent metabolic reactions. The evidence currently available indicates that the extracellular and intracellular (acyl-)CoA degradation pathways are regulated in a coordinated and opposite manner by the nutritional state and maximize the changes in the total intracellular CoA levels that support the metabolic switch between fed and fasted states in organs like the liver. The objective of this review is to update the contribution of these pathways to the regulation of metabolism, physiology and pathology and to highlight the many questions that remain open.},

   abstract = {Coenzyme A (CoASH) is the major low-molecular weight thiol in Staphylococcus aureus and a number of other bacteria; the crystal structure of the S. aureus coenzyme A-disulfide reductase (CoADR), which maintains the reduced intracellular state of CoASH, has recently been reported [Mallett, T.C., Wallen, J.R., Karplus, P.A., Sakai, H., Tsukihara, T., and Claiborne, A. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 11278-89]. In this report we demonstrate that CoASH is the major thiol in Bacillus anthracis; a bioinformatics analysis indicates that three of the four proteins responsible for the conversion of pantothenate (Pan) to CoASH in Escherichia coli are conserved in B. anthracis. In contrast, a novel type III pantothenate kinase (PanK) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway in B. anthracis; unlike the E. coli type I PanK, this enzyme is not subject to feedback inhibition by CoASH. The crystal structure of B. anthracis PanK (BaPanK), solved using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data and refined at a resolution of 2.0 A, demonstrates that BaPanK is a new member of the Acetate and Sugar Kinase/Hsc70/Actin (ASKHA) superfamily. The Pan and ATP substrates have been modeled into the active-site cleft; in addition to providing a clear rationale for the absence of CoASH inhibition, analysis of the Pan-binding pocket has led to the development of two new structure-based motifs (the PAN and INTERFACE motifs). Our analyses also suggest that the type III PanK in the spore-forming B. anthracis plays an essential role in the novel thiol/disulfide redox biology of this category A biodefense pathogen.},

   abstract = {Coenzyme A (CoA) and its derivatives such as acetyl-CoA are essential metabolites for several biosynthetic reactions. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, five enzymes (encoded by essential genes CAB1-CAB5; coenzyme A biosynthesis) are required to perform CoA biosynthesis from pantothenate, cysteine, and ATP. Similar to enzymes from other eukaryotes, yeast pantothenate kinase (PanK, encoded by CAB1) turned out to be inhibited by acetyl-CoA. By genetic selection of intragenic suppressors of a temperature-sensitive cab1 mutant combined with rationale mutagenesis of the presumed acetyl-CoA binding site within PanK, we were able to identify the variant CAB1 W331R, encoding a hyperactive PanK completely insensitive to inhibition by acetyl-CoA. Using a versatile gene integration cassette containing the TPI1 promoter, we constructed strains overexpressing CAB1 W331R in combination with additional genes of CoA biosynthesis (CAB2, CAB3, HAL3, CAB4, and CAB5). In these strains, the level of CoA nucleotides was 15-fold increased, compared to a reference strain without additional CAB genes. Overexpression of wild-type CAB1 instead of CAB1 W331R turned out as substantially less effective (fourfold increase of CoA nucleotides). Supplementation of overproducing strains with additional pantothenate could further elevate the level of CoA (2.3-fold). Minor increases were observed after overexpression of FEN2 (encoding a pantothenate permease) and deletion of PCD1 (CoA-specific phosphatase). We conclude that the strategy described in this work may improve the efficiency of biotechnological applications depending on acetyl-CoA. Key points * A gene encoding a hyperactive yeast pantothenate kinase (PanK) was constructed. * Overexpression of CoA biosynthetic genes elevated CoA nucleotides 15-fold. * Supplementation with pantothenate further increased the level of CoA nucleotides.},

   abstract = {Coenzyme A (CoA) as an essential cofactor for acyl and acetyl transfer reactions is synthesized in five enzymatic steps from pantothenate, cysteine, and ATP. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, products of five essential genes CAB1-CAB5 (coenzyme A biosynthesis) are required to catalyze CoA biosynthesis. In addition, nonessential genes SIS2 and VHS3 similar to CAB3 are also involved. Using epitope-tagged variants of Cab3 and Cab5, we show that both proteins cofractionate upon chromatographic separation, forming a complex of about 330 kDa. We thus systematically investigated interactions among Cab proteins. Our results show that Cab2, Cab3, Cab4, and Cab5 indeed bind to each other, with Cab3 as the sole protein, which can interact with itself and other Cab proteins. Cab3 also binds to Sis2 and Vhs3 that were previously characterized as subunits of phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase. Pantothenate kinase encoded by CAB1 as the rate-limiting enzyme of CoA biosynthesis did not interact with other Cab proteins. Mapping studies revealed that the nonconserved N-terminus of Cab3 is required for dimerization and for binding of Cab2 and Cab5. Our interaction studies confirm early reports on the existence of a CoA-synthesizing protein complex (CoA-SPC) in yeast and provide precise data on protein domains involved in complex formation.},

   abstract = {Invasive candidiasis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with health care-associated infection. The echinocandins have potent fungicidal activity against most Candida species, but there are few data comparing the safety and efficacy of echinocandins in the treatment of invasive candidiasis.|This was an international, randomized, double-blind trial comparing micafungin (100 mg daily) and micafungin (150 mg daily) with a standard dosage of caspofungin (70 mg followed by 50 mg daily) in adults with candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis. The primary end point was treatment success, defined as clinical and mycological success at the end of blinded intravenous therapy.|A total of 595 patients were randomized to one the treatment groups and received at least 1 dose of study drug. In the modified intent-to-treat population, 191 patients were assigned to the micafungin 100 mg group, 199 to the micafungin 150 mg group, and 188 to the caspofungin group. Demographic characteristics and underlying disorders were comparable across the groups. Approximately 85% of patients had candidemia; the remainder had noncandidemic invasive candidiasis. At the end of blinded intravenous therapy, treatment was considered successful for 76.4% of patients in the micafungin 100 mg group, 71.4% in the micafungin 150 mg group, and 72.3% in the caspofungin group. The median time to culture negativity was 2 days in the micafungin 100 mg group and the caspofungin group, compared with 3 days in the micafungin 150 mg groups. There were no significant differences in mortality, relapsing and emergent infections, or adverse events between the study arms.|Dosages of micafungin 100 mg daily and 150 mg daily were noninferior to a standard dosage of caspofungin for the treatment of candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis.},

In our view, the key to tackling the challenges such issues pose to both the future viability of the pharmaceutical industry and advances in healthcare is to substantially increase the number and quality of innovative, cost-effective new medicines, without incurring unsustainable R&D costs. However, it is widely acknowledged that trends in industry R&D productivity have been moving in the opposite direction for a number of years. Here, we present a detailed analysis based on comprehensive, recent, industry-wide data to identify the relative contributions of each of the steps in the drug discovery and development process to overall R&D productivity. We then propose specific strategies that could have the most substantial impact in improving R&D productivity.},

   abstract = {Fungi of the genus Aspergillus are widespread in the environment. Some Aspergillus species, most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus, may lead to a variety of allergic reactions and life-threatening systemic infections in humans. Invasive aspergillosis occurs primarily in patients with severe immunodeficiency, and has dramatically increased in recent years. There are several factors at play that contribute to aspergillosis, including both fungus and host-related factors such as strain virulence and host pulmonary structure/immune status, respectively. The environmental tenacity of Aspergilllus, its dominance in diverse microbial communities/habitats, and its ability to navigate the ecophysiological and biophysical challenges of host infection are attributable, in large part, to a robust stress-tolerance biology and exceptional capacity to generate cell-available energy. Aspects of its stress metabolism, ecology, interactions with diverse animal hosts, clinical presentations and treatment regimens have been well-studied over the past years. Here, we synthesize these findings in relation to the way in which some Aspergillus species have become successful opportunistic pathogens of human- and other animal hosts. We focus on the biophysical capabilities of Aspergillus pathogens, key aspects of their ecophysiology and the flexibility to undergo a sexual cycle or form cryptic species. Additionally, recent advances in diagnosis of the disease are discussed as well as implications in relation to questions that have yet to be resolved.},

   abstract = {Chemically defined media for yeast cultivation (CDMY) were developed to support fast growth, experimental reproducibility, and quantitative analysis of growth rates and biomass yields. In addition to mineral salts and a carbon substrate, popular CDMYs contain seven to nine B-group vitamins, which are either enzyme cofactors or precursors for their synthesis. Despite the widespread use of CDMY in fundamental and applied yeast research, the relation of their design and composition to the actual vitamin requirements of yeasts has not been subjected to critical review since their first development in the 1940s. Vitamins are formally defined as essential organic molecules that cannot be synthesized by an organism. In yeast physiology, use of the term "vitamin" is primarily based on essentiality for humans, but the genome of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae reference strain S288C harbours most of the structural genes required for synthesis of the vitamins included in popular CDMY. Here, we review the biochemistry and genetics of the biosynthesis of these compounds by S. cerevisiae and, based on a comparative genomics analysis, assess the diversity within the Saccharomyces genus with respect to vitamin prototrophy.},

Measures of the incidence and the proportion of all hospital deaths related to deaths from these infections provide estimates of their impact. The objectives of the study were to characterize the secular trends in nosocomial bloodstream infection at a single institution and to estimate the population-attributable risk for death among patients experiencing the infection.|A 12-year retrospective study using prospectively collected data from a hospital-wide surveillance system for nosocomial infections in a 900-bed tertiary care institution. All patients (N = 260,834) admitted to the institution between 1980 and 1992 were included in the study. Bloodstream infection rates were calculated for the 10 leading groups of pathogens, and trends were analyzed using simple linear regression. In-hospital mortality rates from patients who did or did not develop nosocomial blood stream infections were compared.|Between 1980 and 1992, a total of 3077 patients developed 3464 episodes of nosocomial bloodstream infection. The crude infection rates increased linearly from 6.7 to 18.4 per 1000 discharges (0.83 to 1.72 episodes per 1000 patient-days) during the 12-year study period (r = .87). Increases in the infection rates were due to gram-positive cocci (r = .96) and yeasts (r = .95) and essentially explained by infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Candida species, respectively. Although the crude mortality in patients with nosocomial bloodstream infections decreased from 51% in 1981 to 29% in 1992, the in-hospital population-attributable mortality among infected patients increased from 3.55 deaths per 1000 discharges in 1981 to 6.22 per 1000 discharges in 1992 (r = .67). The etiologic fraction or the proportion of deaths in patients with bloodstream infection to all deaths occurring in the hospital increased from 11.4% in 1981 to 20.4% in 1992 (r = .59).|The incidence, the etiologic fraction, and the population-attributable risk for death among patients experiencing nosocomial bloodstream infections increased progressively during the last decade.},

   abstract = {Structural genes have been identified for all of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pantothenic acid in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli K-12, with the exception of ketopantoic acid reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketopantoate to pantoate. The acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase from S. typhimurium efficiently bound alpha-ketopantoate (K(m) = 0.25 mM) and catalyzed its reduction at 1/20 the rate at which alpha-acetolactate was reduced. Since two enzymes could apparently participate in the synthesis of pantoate, a S. typhimurium ilvC8 strain was mutagenized to derive strains completely blocked in the conversion of alpha-ketopantoate to pantoate. Several isolates were obtained that grew in isoleucine-valine medium supplemented with either pantoate or pantothenate, but not in the same medium supplemented with alpha-ketopantoate or beta-alanine. The mutations that conferred pantoate auxotrophy (designated panE) to these isolates appeared to be clustered, but were not linked to panB or panC. All panE strains tested had greatly reduced levels of ketopantoic acid reductase (3 to 12% of the activity present in DU201). The capacity of the isomeroreductase to synthesize pantoate in vivo was assessed by determining the growth requirements of ilvC(+) derivatives of panE ilvC8 strains. These strains required either alpha-ketopantoate, pantoate, or pantothenate when the isomeroreductase was present at low levels; when the synthesis of isomeroreductase was induced, panE ilvC(+) strains grew in unsupplemented medium. These phenotypes indicate that a high level of isomeroreductase is sufficient for the synthesis of pantoate. panE ilvC(+) strains also grew in medium supplemented with lysine and methionine. This phenotype resembles that of some S. typhimurium ilvG mutants (e.g., DU501) which are partially blocked in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A and are limited for succinyl coenzyme A. panE ilvC(+) strains which lack the acetohydroxy acid synthases required only methionine for growth (in the presence of leucine, isoleucine, and valine). This and other evidence suggested that the synthesis of pantoic acid by isomeroreductase was blocked by the alpha-acetohydroxy acids and that pantoic acid synthesis was enhanced in the absence of these intermediates, even when the isomeroreductase was at low levels. panE ilvC(+) strains reverted to pantothenate independence. Several of these revertants were shown to have elevated isomeroreductase levels under noninduced and induced conditions; the suppressing mutation in each revertant was shown to be closely linked to ilvC by P22 transduction. This procedure presents a means for obtaining mutants with altered regulation of isomeroreductase.},

   abstract = {The frequency of fungal infections is increasing due to immunodeficiency viruses and immunosuppressive drugs. The most common fungal infection of the oral cavity is candidiasis. The existence of Candida can be a part of normal commensal; hence, the isolation of Candida in the absence of clinical symptoms should exclude candidiasis. The pathogenicity of Candida is witnessed as opportunistic when immune status is compromised. Oral fungal infections are uncommon, but when identified, these infections are associated with greater discomfort and are sometimes destruction of tissues. Cytology and tissue biopsy are helpful in confirming the clinical diagnosis. The management of oral fungal infections must strategically focus on signs, symptoms, and culture reports. This article reviews information on diagnosis and therapeutic management of aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, mucormycosis, and geotrichosis.},

   abstract = {The biology of Candida albicans, including dimorphism and virulence, is significantly influenced by environmental pH. The response to ambient pH includes the pH-conditional expression of several genes, which is directly or indirectly regulated by Rim101p. Rim101p is homologous to PacC, a transcription factor that regulates pH-conditional gene expression in Aspergillus nidulans. PacC binds 5'-GCCARG-3' sequences upstream of pH-responsive genes and either activates or represses transcription. The absence of pacC consensus binding sites upstream of PHR1, a RIM101-dependent, alkaline pH-induced gene of C. albicans, suggested either that PHR1 is indirectly regulated by Rim101p or that the binding specificity of Rim101p is different. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that Rim101p strongly bound two regions upstream of PHR1 that were only weakly bound by PacC. Deletion analysis and site-specific mutagenesis demonstrated that both sites were functionally significant, mutation of either site reduced RIM101-dependent induction, and expression was abolished in the double mutant. Furthermore, oligonucleotides containing these sites conferred pH-conditional expression when inserted upstream of a reporter gene. The consensus sequence of these sites, 5'-CCAAGAAA-3', was identical to the binding recognition sequence identified by in vitro selection of Rim101p binding oligonucleotides from a random pool. The functional significance of this binding sequence was reinforced by its observed presence upstream of a number of newly identified pH-conditional genes. We conclude that Rim101p acts as a transcription factor and directly regulates pH-conditional gene expression but has a binding specificity different from that of PacC.},

   abstract = {Anidulafungin, a new echinocandin, has potent activity against candida species. We compared anidulafungin with fluconazole in a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial of treatment for invasive candidiasis.|Adults with invasive candidiasis were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous anidulafungin or intravenous fluconazole. All patients could receive oral fluconazole after 10 days of intravenous therapy. The primary efficacy analysis assessed the global response (clinical and microbiologic) at the end of intravenous therapy in patients who had a positive baseline culture. Efficacy was also assessed at other time points.|Eighty-nine percent of the 245 patients in the primary analysis had candidemia only. Candida albicans was isolated in 62% of the 245 patients. In vitro fluconazole resistance was infrequent. Most of the patients (97%) did not have neutropenia. At the end of intravenous therapy, treatment was successful in 75.6% of patients treated with anidulafungin, as compared with 60.2% of those treated with fluconazole (difference, 15.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 27.0). The results were similar for other efficacy end points. The statistical analyses failed to show a "center effect"; when data from the site enrolling the largest number of patients were removed, success rates at the end of intravenous therapy were 73.2% in the anidulafungin group and 61.1% in the fluconazole group (difference, 12.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.1 to 25.3). The frequency and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups. The rate of death from all causes was 31% in the fluconazole group and 23% in the anidulafungin group (P=0.13).|Anidulafungin was shown to be noninferior to fluconazole in the treatment of invasive candidiasis.

   abstract = {Candida albicans is the most common cause of candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis. Systemic infections due to C. albicans exhibit good susceptibility to fluconazole and echinocandins. However, the echinocandin anidulafungin was recently demonstrated to be more effective than fluconazole for systemic Candida infections in a randomized, double-blind trial among 245 patients. In that trial, most infections were caused by C. albicans, and all respective isolates were susceptible to randomized study drug. We sought to better understand the factors associated with the enhanced efficacy of anidulafungin and hypothesized that intrinsic properties of the antifungal agents contributed to the treatment differences.|Global responses at end of intravenous study treatment in patients with C. albicans infection were compared post-hoc. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict response and to adjust for differences in independent baseline characteristics. Analyses focused on time to negative blood cultures, persistent infection at end of intravenous study treatment, and 6-week survival.|In total, 135 patients with C. albicans infections were identified. Among these, baseline APACHE II scores were similar between treatment arms. In these patients, global response was significantly better for anidulafungin than fluconazole (81.1% vs 62.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference, 3.7-33.9). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, the odds ratio for global response was 2.36 (95% CI, 1.06-5.25). Study treatment and APACHE II score were significant predictors of outcome. The most predictive logistic regression model found that the odds ratio for study treatment was 2.60 (95% CI, 1.14-5.91) in favor of anidulafungin, and the odds ratio for APACHE II score was 0.935 (95% CI, 0.885-0.987), with poorer responses associated with higher baseline APACHE II scores. Anidulafungin was associated with significantly faster clearance of blood cultures (log-rank p < 0.05) and significantly fewer persistent infections (2.7% vs 13.1%; p < 0.05). Survival through 6 weeks did not differ between treatment groups.|In patients with C. albicans infection, anidulafungin was more effective than fluconazole, with more rapid clearance of positive blood cultures. This suggests that the fungicidal activity of echinocandins may have important clinical implications.|ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00058682.},

   abstract = {Pantothenate kinase (PanK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of pantothenate, the first committed and rate-limiting step toward coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. In our earlier reports, we had established that the type I isoform encoded by the coaA gene is an essential pantothenate kinase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and this vital information was then exploited to screen large libraries for identification of mechanistically different classes of PanK inhibitors. The present report summarizes the synthesis and expansion efforts to understand the structure-activity relationships leading to the optimization of enzyme inhibition along with antimycobacterial activity. Additionally, we report the progression of two distinct classes of inhibitors, the triazoles, which are ATP competitors, and the biaryl acetic acids, with a mixed mode of inhibition. Cocrystallization studies provided evidence of these inhibitors binding to the enzyme. This was further substantiated with the biaryl acids having MIC against the wild-type M. tuberculosis strain and the subsequent establishment of a target link with an upshift in MIC in a strain overexpressing PanK. On the other hand, the ATP competitors had cellular activity only in a M. tuberculosis knockdown strain with reduced PanK expression levels. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo survival kinetic studies performed with a M. tuberculosis PanK (MtPanK) knockdown strain indicated that the target levels have to be significantly reduced to bring in growth inhibition. The dual approaches employed here thus established the poor vulnerability of PanK in M. tuberculosis.},

   abstract = {The availability of reproducible antifungal susceptibility testing methods now permits analysis of data correlating susceptibility in vitro with outcome in vivo in order to define interpretive breakpoints. In this paper, we have examined the conceptual framework underlying interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing results and then used these ideas to drive analysis of data packages developed by the respective manufacturers that correlate fluconazole and itraconazole MICs with outcome of candidal infections. Tentative fluconazole interpretive breakpoints for MICs determined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards' M27-T broth macrodilution methodology are proposed: isolates for which MICs are < or = 8 microg/mL are susceptible to fluconazole, whereas those for which MICs are > or = 64 microg/mL appear resistant. Isolates for which the MIC of fluconazole is 16-32 microg/mL are considered susceptible dependent upon dose (S-DD), on the basis of data indicating clinical response when > 100 mg of fluconazole per day is given. These breakpoints do not, however, apply to Candida krusei, as it is considered inherently resistant to fluconazole. Tentative interpretive MIC breakpoints for itraconazole apply only to mucosal candidal infections and are as follows: susceptible, < or = 0.125 microg/mL; S-DD, 0.25-0.5 microg/mL; and resistant, > or = 1.0 microg/mL. These tentative breakpoints are now open for public commentary.},

   abstract = {Pantothenate kinase (PanK) is the key regulatory enzyme in the CoA biosynthetic pathway in bacteria and is thought to play a similar role in mammalian cells. We examined this hypothesis by identifying and characterizing two murine cDNAs that encoded PanK. The two cDNAs were predicted to arise from alternate splicing of the same gene to yield different mRNAs that encode two isoforms (mPanK1alpha and mPanK1beta) with distinct amino termini. The predicted protein sequence of mPanK1 was not related to bacterial PanK but exhibited significant similarity to Aspergillus nidulans PanK. mPanK1alpha was most highly expressed in heart and kidney, whereas mPanK1beta mRNA was detected primarily in liver and kidney. Pantothenate was the most abundant pathway component (42.8%) in normal cells providing clear evidence that pantothenate phosphorylation was a rate-controlling step in CoA biosynthesis. Enhanced mPanK1beta expression eliminated the intracellular pantothenate pool and triggered a 13-fold increase in intracellular CoA content. mPanK1beta activity in vitro was stimulated by CoA and strongly inhibited by acetyl-CoA illustrating that differential modulation of mPanK1beta activity by pathway end products also contributed to the management of CoA levels. These data support the concept that the expression and/or activity of PanK is a determining factor in the physiological regulation of the intracellular CoA concentration.},

   abstract = {With the advent of HIV and the widespread emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, newer control strategies in the form of a better vaccine could decrease the global incidence of tuberculosis. A desirable trait in an effective live attenuated vaccine strain is an ability to persist within the host in a limited fashion in order to produce important protective antigens in vivo. Attenuated M. tuberculosis vaccine candidates have been constructed by deleting genes required for growth in mice. These candidate vaccines did not elicit adequate protective immunity in animal models, due to their inability to persist sufficiently long within the host tissues. Here we report that an auxotrophic mutant of M. tuberculosis defective in the de novo biosynthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is highly attenuated in immunocompromised SCID mice and in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. SCID mice infected with the pantothenate auxotroph survived significantly longer (250 days) than mice infected with either bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine or virulent M. tuberculosis (77 and 35 days, respectively). Subcutaneous immunization with this auxotroph conferred protection in C57BL/6J mice against an aerosol challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis, which was comparable with that afforded by BCG vaccination. Our findings highlight the importance of de novo pantothenate biosynthesis in limiting the intracellular survival and pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis without reducing its immunogenicity in vaccinated mice.},

   abstract = {Knowing the full set of essential genes for a given organism provides important information about ways to promote, and to limit, its growth and survival. For many non-model organisms, the lack of a stable haploid state and low transformation efficiencies impede the use of conventional approaches to generate a genome-wide comprehensive set of mutant strains and the identification of the genes essential for growth. Here we report on the isolation and utilization of a highly stable haploid derivative of the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, together with a modified heterologous transposon and machine learning (ML) analysis method, to predict the degree to which all of the open reading frames are required for growth under standard laboratory conditions. We identified 1,610 C. albicans essential genes, including 1,195 with high "essentiality confidence" scores, thereby increasing the number of essential genes (currently 66 in the Candida Genome Database) by >20-fold and providing an unbiased approach to determine the degree of confidence in the determination of essentiality. Among the genes essential in C. albicans were 602 genes also essential in the model budding and fission yeasts analyzed by both deletion and transposon mutagenesis. We also identified essential genes conserved among the four major human pathogens C. albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum and highlight those that lack homologs in humans and that thus could serve as potential targets for the design of antifungal therapies.IMPORTANCE Comprehensive understanding of an organism requires that we understand the contributions of most, if not all, of its genes. Classical genetic approaches to this issue have involved systematic deletion of each gene in the genome, with comprehensive sets of mutants available only for very-well-studied model organisms. We took a different approach, harnessing the power of in vivo transposition coupled with deep sequencing to identify >500,000 different mutations, one per cell, in the prevalent human fungal pathogen Candida albicans and to map their positions across the genome. The transposition approach is efficient and less labor-intensive than classic approaches. Here, we describe the production and analysis (aided by machine learning) of a large collection of mutants and the comprehensive identification of 1,610 C. albicans genes that are essential for growth under standard laboratory conditions. Among these C. albicans essential genes, we identify those that are also essential in two distantly related model yeasts as well as those that are conserved in all four major human fungal pathogens and that are not conserved in the human genome. This list of genes with functions important for the survival of the pathogen provides a good starting point for the development of new antifungal drugs, which are greatly needed because of the emergence of fungal pathogens with elevated resistance and/or tolerance of the currently limited set of available antifungal drugs.},

   abstract = {Candidiasis is a multifaceted fungal disease including mucosal-cutaneous, visceral, and disseminated infections caused by yeast species of the genus Candida. Candida infections are among the most common human mycoses. Candida species are the third to fourth most common isolates from bloodstream infections in neutropenic or immunocompromised hospitalized patients. The mucosal-cutaneous forms—particularly vaginal infections—have a high prevalence. Vaginitis caused by Candida species is the second most common vaginal infection. Hence, candidiasis is a major subject for research, including experimental in vivo models to study pathogenesis, prevention, or therapy of the disease. The following review article will focus on various experimental in vivo models in different laboratory animals, such as mammals (mice, rats, rabbits), the fruit ﬂy–Drosophila melanogaster, the larvae of the moth Galleria mellonella, or the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The review will describe the induction of the different clinical forms of candidiasis in the various models and the validity of such models in mimicking the human clinical situations. The use of such models for the assessment of antifungal drugs, evaluation of potential vaccines to protect before candidiasis, exploration of Candida virulence factors, and comparison of pathogenicity of different Candida species will be included in the review. All of the above will be reported as based on published studies of numerous investigators as well as on the research of the author and his group.},

There are three human PANK genes, and inactivating mutations in PANK2 lead to pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN). Here we performed a library screen followed by chemical optimization to produce PZ-2891, an allosteric PANK activator that crosses the blood brain barrier. PZ-2891 occupies the pantothenate pocket and engages the dimer interface to form a PANK*ATP*Mg(2+)*PZ-2891 complex. The binding of PZ-2891 to one protomer locks the opposite protomer in a catalytically active conformation that is refractory to acetyl-CoA inhibition. Oral administration of PZ-2891 increases CoA levels in mouse liver and brain. A knockout mouse model of brain CoA deficiency exhibited weight loss, severe locomotor impairment and early death. Knockout mice on PZ-2891 therapy gain weight, and have improved locomotor activity and life span establishing pantazines as novel therapeutics for the treatment of PKAN.},

The antisense-based sensitization of bacterial targets in Staphylococcus aureus is one of the new approaches that provides increased sensitivity for the detection of target-specific antibiotics and whole-cell screening assays based on differential sensitivity of target-depleted strains. The screening of natural product extracts using this type of assay designed for condensing enzyme (FabH/FabF) targets of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway led to the discovery of a number of target-specific inhibitors including the novel antibiotic platensimycin, which has displayed activity against various drug-resistant bacteria. The antisense-based discovery strategy, rationale and design of screening assays, and the application of such assays for screening of natural product extracts and the discovery of fatty acid condensing enzyme inhibitors are reviewed in this article.},

   abstract = {Computer-aided drug discovery/design methods have played a major role in the development of therapeutically important small molecules for over three decades. These methods are broadly classified as either structure-based or ligand-based methods. Structure-based methods are in principle analogous to high-throughput screening in that both target and ligand structure information is imperative. Structure-based approaches include ligand docking, pharmacophore, and ligand design methods. The article discusses theory behind the most important methods and recent successful applications. Ligand-based methods use only ligand information for predicting activity depending on its similarity/dissimilarity to previously known active ligands. We review widely used ligand-based methods such as ligand-based pharmacophores, molecular descriptors, and quantitative structure-activity relationships. In addition, important tools such as target/ligand data bases, homology modeling, ligand fingerprint methods, etc., necessary for successful implementation of various computer-aided drug discovery/design methods in a drug discovery campaign are discussed. Finally, computational methods for toxicity prediction and optimization for favorable physiologic properties are discussed with successful examples from literature.},

   abstract = {Although membrane proteins account for approximately 30 % of the coding regions of all sequenced genomes and play crucial roles in many fundamental cell processes, there are relatively few membranes with known 3D structure. This is likely due to technical challenges associated with membrane protein extraction, solubilization, and purification. Membrane proteins are classified based on the level of interaction with membrane lipid bilayers, with peripheral membrane proteins associating noncovalently with the membrane, and integral membrane proteins associating more strongly by means of hydrophobic interactions. Generally speaking, peripheral membrane proteins can be purified by milder techniques than integral membrane proteins, whose extraction require phospholipid bilayer disruption by detergents. Here, important criteria for strategies of membrane protein purification are addressed, with a focus on the initial stages of membrane protein solublilization, where problems are most frequently are encountered. Protocols are outlined for the successful extraction of peripheral membrane proteins, solubilization of integral membrane proteins, and detergent removal which is important not only for retaining native protein stability and biological functions, but also for the efficiency of downstream purification techniques.},

   abstract = {Pantothenic acid, a precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), is essential for the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. Since the structure of pantothenic acid was determined, many analogues of this essential metabolite have been prepared. Several have been demonstrated to exert an antimicrobial effect against a range of microorganisms by inhibiting the utilization of pantothenic acid, validating pantothenic acid utilization as a potential novel antimicrobial drug target. This review commences with an overview of the mechanisms by which various microorganisms acquire the pantothenic acid they require for growth, and the universal CoA biosynthesis pathway by which pantothenic acid is converted into CoA. A detailed survey of studies that have investigated the inhibitory activity of analogues of pantothenic acid and other precursors of CoA follows. The potential of inhibitors of both pantothenic acid utilization and biosynthesis as novel antibacterial, antifungal and antimalarial agents is discussed, focusing on inhibitors and substrates of pantothenate kinase, the enzyme catalysing the rate-limiting step of CoA biosynthesis in many organisms. The best strategies are considered for identifying inhibitors of pantothenic acid utilization and biosynthesis that are potent and selective inhibitors of microbial growth and that may be suitable for use as chemotherapeutic agents in humans.},

   abstract = {The product of the FEN2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has previously been described as a protein conferring sensitivity to the antifungal agent fenpropimorph. Fen2p was postulated to act as a common regulator of carbon and nitrogen catabolite repression and of amino acid and ergosterol biosynthesis. In this paper, we present experimental evidence characterizing Fen2p as a plasma membrane-localized transporter for the vitamin pantothenate. The high affinity transport system (Km = 3.5 microM) is sensitive to uncouplers, suggesting a H+-pantothenate cotransport. Pantothenate transport rates in yeast are modulated by extracellular pantothenate, being maximal at low pantothenate concentrations. It is demonstrated that beta-alanine can suppress the growth defect of FEN2 wild-type and fen2 mutant cells on pantothenate-free medium. Evidence is presented that beta-alanine is transported by the general amino acid permease Gap1p. The relation among pantothenate transport, nitrogen catabolite repression, and sensitivity to the antifungal agent fenpropimorph is discussed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were a) to investigate the effect of targeting the PANoptosome with 3,4-methylenedioxy-beta-nitrostyrene (MNS) on PANoptosis in the Renal ischemia-reperfussion (RIR) model b) to investigate the kidney protective effect of MNS toward RIR injury. METHODS: Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups randomly. The groups were assigned as Control, Sham, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and MNS groups. The rats in the MNS group were intraperitoneally given 20 mg/kg of MNS 30 minutes before reperfusion. 2% DMSO solvent that dissolves MNS were given to the rats in DMSO group. Left nephrectomy was performed on the rats under anesthesia at the 6th hour after reperfusion. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 8-Okso-2'-deoksiguanozin (8-OHdG) levels were measured. Immunohistochemical analysis, electron microscopic and histological examinations were carried out in the tissues. RESULTS: Total tubular injury score was lower in the MNS group (p < 0.001). Caspase-3, Gasdermin D and MLK (Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain Like Pseudokinase) expressions were considerably decreased in the MNS group (p < 0.001). Apoptotic index (AI) was found to be low in the MNS group (p < 0.001). CAT and SOD levels were higher in the MNS Group (p = 0.006, p = 0.0004, respectively). GPx, MDA, and 8-OH-dG levels were similar (p > 0.05) in all groups. MNS considerably improved the tissue structure, based on the electron microscopic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that MNS administrated before the reperfusion reduces pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis. These findings suggest that MNS significantly protects the kidney against RIR injury by reducing PANoptosis as a result of specific inhibition of Nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP 3), one of the PANoptosome proteins.},

   abstract = {Pantothenate kinase catalyzes the rate-controlling step in the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway, and its activity is modulated by the size of the CoA pool. The effect of nonesterified CoA (CoASH) and CoA thioesters on the activity of pantothenate kinase was examined to determine which component of the CoA pool is the most effective regulator of the enzyme from Escherichia coli. CoASH was five times more potent than acetyl-CoA or other CoA thioesters as an inhibitor of pantothenate kinase activity in vitro. Inhibition by CoA thioesters was not due to their hydrolysis to CoASH. CoASH inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP, thus providing a mechanism to coordinate CoA production with the energy state of the cell. There were considerable differences in the size and composition of the CoA pool in cells grown on different carbon sources, and a carbon source shift experiment was used to test the inhibitory effect of the different CoA species in vivo. A shift from glucose to acetate as the carbon source resulted in an increase in the CoASH:acetyl-CoA ratio from 0.7 to 4.3. The alteration in the CoA pool composition was associated with the selective inhibition of pantothenate phosphorylation, consistent with CoASH being a more potent regulator of pantothenate kinase activity in vivo. These results demonstrate that CoA biosynthesis is regulated through feedback inhibition of pantothenate kinase primarily by the concentration of CoASH and secondarily by the size of the CoA thioester pool.},

   abstract = {The transport system for pantothenic acid uptake in Escherichia coli was characterized. This transport system was specific for pantothenate, had a Kt of 0.4 microM, and had a maximum velocity of 1.6 pmol/min per 10(8) cells (45 pmol/min per mg [dry weight]). Pantothenate uptake was not reduced in osmotically shocked cells or by ATP depletion with arsenate, but was reduced greater than 90% by the dissipation of the membrane electrochemical gradient with 2,4-dinitrophenol. Sodium ions stimulated pantothenate uptake (Kt, 0.8 mM) by reducing the Kt for pantothenate by an order of magnitude. Intracellular pantothenate was rapidly phosphorylated, but phosphorylation of pantothenate was not required for uptake since pantothenate was the only labeled intracellular compound concentrated by ATP-depleted, glucose-energized cells. The data were consistent with the presence of a high-affinity pantothenate permease that concentrates the vitamin by sodium cotransport.},

   abstract = {The natural product CJ-15,801 is an inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus, but not other bacteria. Its close structural resemblance to pantothenic acid, the vitamin precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), and its Michael acceptor moiety suggest that it irreversibly inhibits an enzyme involved in CoA biosynthesis or utilization. However, its mode of action and the basis for its specificity have not been elucidated to date. We demonstrate that CJ-15,801 is transformed by the uniquely selective S. aureus pantothenate kinase, the first CoA biosynthetic enzyme, into a substrate for the next enzyme, phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase, which is inhibited through formation of a tight-binding structural mimic of its native reaction intermediate. These findings reveal CJ-15,801 as a vitamin biosynthetic pathway antimetabolite with a mechanism similar to that of the sulfonamide antibiotics and highlight CoA biosynthesis as a viable antimicrobial drug target.},

   abstract = {A set of novel pantothenamide-type analogues of the known Staphylococcus aureus pantothenate kinase (SaPanK) inhibitors, N-pentyl, and N-heptylpantothenamide, was synthesized in three series. The first series of analogues (1-3) were designed as molecular probes of the PanK binding site to elucidate important structure-activity relationships (SAR). The second series of analogues (4-16) were designed using structural information obtained from the Escherichia coli PanK (EcPanK) structure by targeting the pantothenate binding site and the adjacent phenylalanine-lined lipophilic pocket. Insight into the antimicrobial effect of N-pentylpantothenamide (N5-Pan) through its conversion to the antimetabolite ethyldethia-CoA and further incorporation into an inactive acyl carrier protein analogue drove the development of the third series of analogues (17-25) to enhance this effect using substrate-like substitutions. Each of the analogues was screened for enzyme inhibition activity against a panel of pantothenate kinases consisting of EcPanK, Aspergillus nidulans (AnPanK), SaPanK, and the murine isoform (MmPanK1alpha). Series 1 demonstrated only modest inhibitory activity, but did reveal some important SAR findings including stereospecific binding. Series 2 demonstrated a much higher inhibition rate for the entire series and significant inhibition was seen with analogues containing alkyl substituents. Series 3 demonstrated the most preferential inhibition profile, with the highest inhibitory activity against the SaPanK and MmPanK1alpha. The MmPanK1alpha protein was inhibited by a broad spectrum of the compounds, whereas the E. coli enzyme showed greater selectivity. The overall activity data from these analogues suggest a complex and non-enzyme specific SAR for pantothenamide substrate/inhibitors of the different PanK enzymes.},

Caspofungin, a member of the new echinocandin class of compounds, may be an effective alternative that is better tolerated than amphotericin B.|In this randomized, double-blind, multinational trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of caspofungin as compared with liposomal amphotericin B as empirical antifungal therapy. At study entry, patients were stratified according to risk and according to whether they had previously received antifungal prophylaxis. A successful outcome was defined as the fulfillment of all components of a five-part composite end point.|Efficacy was evaluated in 1095 patients (556 receiving caspofungin and 539 receiving liposomal amphotericin B). After adjustment for strata, the overall success rates were 33.9 percent for caspofungin and 33.7 percent for liposomal amphotericin B (95.2 percent confidence interval for the difference, -5.6 to 6.0 percent), fulfilling statistical criteria for the noninferiority of caspofungin. Among patients with baseline fungal infections, a higher proportion of those treated with caspofungin had a successful outcome (51.9 percent vs. 25.9 percent, P=0.04). The proportion of patients who survived at least seven days after therapy was greater in the caspofungin group (92.6 percent vs. 89.2 percent, P=0.05). Premature study discontinuation occurred less often in the caspofungin group than in the amphotericin B group (10.3 percent vs. 14.5 percent, P=0.03). The rates of breakthrough fungal infections and resolution of fever during neutropenia were similar in the two groups. Fewer patients who received caspofungin sustained a nephrotoxic effect (2.6 percent vs. 11.5 percent, P<0.001), an infusion-related event (35.1 percent vs. 51.6 percent, P<0.001), or a drug-related adverse event or discontinued therapy because of drug-related adverse events.|Caspofungin is as effective as and generally better tolerated than liposomal amphotericin B when given as empirical antifungal therapy in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia.},

   abstract = {Pantothenate biosynthesis is essential for the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and this pathway thus presents potential drug targets against tuberculosis. We determined the crystal structure of pantothenate synthetase (PS) from M. tuberculosis, and its complexes with AMPCPP, pantoate, and a reaction intermediate, pantoyl adenylate, with resolutions from 1.6 to 2 A. PS catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of pantoate and beta-alanine to form pantothenate. Its structure reveals a dimer, and each subunit has two domains with tight association between domains. The active-site cavity is on the N-terminal domain, partially covered by the C-terminal domain. One wall of the active site cavity is flexible, which allows the bulky AMPCPP to diffuse into the active site to nearly full occupancy when crystals are soaked in solutions containing AMPCPP. Crystal structures of the complexes with AMPCPP and pantoate indicate that the enzyme binds ATP and pantoate tightly in the active site, and brings the carboxyl oxygen of pantoate near the alpha-phosphorus atom of ATP for an in-line nucleophilic attack. When crystals were soaked with, or grown in the presence of, both ATP and pantoate, a reaction intermediate, pantoyl adenylate, is found in the active site. The flexible wall of the active site cavity becomes ordered when the intermediate is in the active site, thus protecting it from being hydrolyzed. Binding of beta-alanine can occur only after pantoyl adenylate is formed inside the active site cavity. The tight binding of the intermediate pantoyl adenylate suggests that nonreactive analogs of pantoyl adenylate may be inhibitors of the PS enzyme with high affinity and specificity.},

   title = {Increased mRNA Levels ofERG16,CDR, andMDR1Correlatewith Increases in Azole Resistance inCandida albicansIsolatesfrom a Patient Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus},
   abstract = {Resistance to antifungal drugs, specifically azoles such as fluconazole, in the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans has become an increasing problem in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this resistance have only recently become apparent and can include alterations in the target enzyme of the azole drugs (lanosterol 14alpha demethylase [14DM]), or in various efflux pumps from both the ABC transporter and major facilitator gene families. To determine which of these possible mechanisms was associated with the development of drug resistance in a particular case, mRNA levels have been studied in a series of 17 clinical isolates taken from a single HIV-infected patient over 2 years, during which time the levels of fluconazole resistance of the strain increased over 200-fold. Using Northern blot analysis of steady-state levels of total RNA from these isolates, we observed increased mRNA levels of ERG16 (the 14DM-encoding gene), CDR1 (an ABC transporter), and MDR1 (a major facilitator) in this series. The timing of the increase in mRNA levels of each of these genes correlated with increases in fluconazole resistance of the isolates. Increased mRNA levels were not observed for three other ABC transporters, two other genes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, or the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase gene that transfers electrons from NADPH to 14DM. Increases in mRNA levels of ERG16 and CDR1 correlated with increased cross-resistance to ketoconazole and itraconazole but not to amphotericin B. A compilation of the genetic alterations identified in this series suggests that resistance develops gradually and is the sum of several different changes, all of which contribute to the final resistant phenotype},

   abstract = {Pantothenic acid and beta-alanine are metabolic intermediates in coenzyme A biosynthesis. Using a functional screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a putative amine oxidase, encoded by FMS1, was found to be rate-limiting for beta-alanine and pantothenic acid biosynthesis. Overexpression of FMS1 caused excess pantothenic acid to be excreted into the medium, whereas deletion mutants required beta-alanine or pantothenic acid for growth. Furthermore, yeast genes ECM31 and YIL145c, which both have structural homology to genes of the bacterial pantothenic acid pathway, were also required for pantothenic acid biosynthesis. The homology of FMS1 to FAD-containing amine oxidases and its role in beta-alanine biosynthesis suggested that its substrates are polyamines. Indeed, we found that all the enzymes of the polyamine pathway in yeast are necessary for beta-alanine biosynthesis; spe1Delta, spe2Delta, spe3Delta, and spe4Delta are all beta-alanine auxotrophs. Thus, contrary to previous reports, yeast is naturally capable of pantothenic acid biosynthesis, and the beta-alanine is derived from methionine via a pathway involving spermine. These findings should facilitate the identification of further enzymes and biochemical pathways involved in polyamine degradation and pantothenic acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae and raise questions about these pathways in other organisms.},

   abstract = {Disruption of newly identified genes in the pathogen Candida albicans is a vital step in determination of gene function. Several gene disruption methods described previously employ long regions of homology flanking a selectable marker. Here, we describe disruption of C. albicans genes with PCR products that have 50 to 60 bp of homology to a genomic sequence on each end of a selectable marker. We used the method to disrupt two known genes, ARG5 and ADE2, and two sequences newly identified through the Candida genome project, HRM101 and ENX3. HRM101 and ENX3 are homologous to genes in the conserved RIM101 (previously called RIM1) and PacC pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus nidulans. We show that three independent hrm101/hrm101 mutants and two independent enx3/enx3 mutants are defective in filamentation on Spider medium. These observations argue that HRM101 and ENX3 sequences are indeed portions of genes and that the respective gene products have related functions.},

   abstract = {Reported normal concentrations for human whole-blood total pantothenic acid vary from 1.1 to 12 mumol/L. This wide range may partly arise from the various enzymes used for liberation of pantothenic acid from coenzyme A, particularly the source of pantetheinase. A purified pantetheinase from pig kidney had greater than 100 times the specific activity and less than 0.01 times the pantothenate content of other commonly used extracts. Endogenous pantetheinase activity in human plasma was identified (11.2 +/- 2.0 mumol pantothenate .min-1.L-1, n = 29) and found comparable to the activity usually added from exogenous sources for liberation of pantothenate from whole blood (1-13 mumol.min-1.L-1). Alkaline phosphatase alone liberated as much pantothenate from hemolyzed whole blood as did alkaline phosphatase with pantetheinase. Previous reports of total blood pantothenate may be elevated by pantothenate in the pantetheinase extracts, an unnecessary source of error. Whole-blood total pantothenate concentrations less than 4.6 mumol/L are normal and do not indicate deficiency, as is often currently quoted.},

   abstract = {The current success rate of a drug candidate, from the beginning of the clinical trial to receiving marketing approval, is about 10%-20%, and it has not changed during the past few decades. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to select one compound, among many others, with a high probability of success. The differences in drug features affect their probabilities of approval success. In this study, we examined the approval success rates of drug candidates, developed in the United States, the European Union, or Japan, by focusing on four parameters ("drug target," "drug action," "drug modality," and "drug application") and their combinations, and identified factors that conditioned the outcome of the drug development process. We obtained a total success rate of 12.8%, after evaluating 3999 compounds. Moreover, after analyzing the combinations of these parameters, the approval success rates of drugs that corresponded to the following categories-a stimulant in drug action or an enzyme in drug target and biologics (excluding monoclonal antibody) in drug modality-were high (34.1% and 31.3%, respectively). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that stimulant in drug action, and "B" (blood and blood forming organs), "G" (genito-urinary system and sex), and "J" (anti-infectives for systemic use) in drug application were statistically associated with high approval success rates. We found several parameters and their combinations that affected drug approval success rates. Our results could assist pharmaceutical companies in evaluating the probability of success of their drug candidates and, thus, in efficiently conducting the clinical development process.},

Using a similar system, we screened a small library of compounds and identified actinomycin D (ActD) as a weak inhibitor of pantothenate synthetase. A new method was established to discover more effective inhibitors by determining the molecular mechanism of ActD inhibition followed by structure-based virtual screening. The molecular interaction of inhibition was determined by circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence quenching. The structure-based search and virtual screening were performed using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) program and SYBYL 7.5, respectively. Two inhibitors were identified with an IC(50) for pantothenate synthetase that was at least ten times better than that of ActD.},

These technologies cover a wide kinetic timescale spanning up to nine orders of magnitude from milliseconds to days. Automated stopped flow measures transient and (pre)steady state kinetics from milliseconds to seconds. For seconds to hours timescale kinetics we discuss surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor, global progress curve analysis for high throughput kinetic profiling of enzyme inhibitors and activators, and filtration plate-based radioligand or fluorescent binding assays for receptor binding kinetics. Jump dilution after pre-incubation is the preferred method for very slow kinetics lasting for days. The basic principles, best practices and simulated data for these technologies are described. Finally, the application of a universal label-free technology, liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), is briefly reviewed. Select literature references are highlighted for in-depth understanding. A new reality is dawning wherein binding kinetics is an integral and routine part of mechanism of action elucidation and translational, quantitative pharmacology for drug discovery.},

   abstract = {Pantothenate synthetase (EC 6.3.2.1), encoded by the panC gene, catalyzes the essential ATPdependent condensation of D-pantoate and β-alanine to form pantothenate in bacteria, yeast and plants. Pantothenate synthetase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and found to be a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 33 kDa. Initial velocity, product, and dead-end inhibition studies showed the kinetic mechanism of pantothenate synthetase to be Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping Pong, with ATP binding followed by D-pantoate binding, release of PPi, binding of β-alanine, followed by the release of pantothenate and AMP. Michaelis constants were 0.13, 0.8, and 2.6 mM for D-pantoate, β-alanine, and ATP, respectively, and the turnover number, kcat, was 3.4 s-1. The formation of pantoyl adenylate, suggested as a key intermediate by the kinetic mechanism, was confirmed by 31P NMR spectroscopy of [18O]AMP produced from 18O transfer using [carboxyl-18O]pantoate. Single-turnover reactions for the formation of pyrophosphate and pantothenate were determined using rapid quench techniques, and indicated that the two half-reactions occurred with maximum rates of 1.3 ( 0.3 and 2.6 ( 0.3 s-1, respectively, consistent with pantoyl adenylate being a kinetically competent intermediate in the pantothenate synthetase reaction. These data also suggest that both half-reactions are partially ratelimiting. Reverse isotope exchange of [14C]-β-alanine into pantothenate in the presence of AMP was observed, indicating the reversible formation of the pantoyl adenylate intermediate from products.},
